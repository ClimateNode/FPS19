## Place names with coordinates

### Fulmer Lane, Denham
* Standing/pooled water in vegetation and a small stream/drainage channel adjacent to the lane; temporary barrier (white cylindrical sandbag-like object) placed along the stream bank and partially submerged, documenting flooding of the channel and bank. (p1)
* Silted ditches along Fulmer Lane were unable to convey surface water runoff during heavy rain, contributing to flooding that affected the M25; ditches were subsequently re-dug and cleared by TfB and the Highways Agency. (p4) [PAG]
* Ditches along Fulmer Lane were silted and therefore unable to convey surface water away from the area, contributing to flooding of the nearby M25. (p5)
* Flooding occurred on Fulmer Lane in Gerrards Cross (just west of the M25), prompting a Section 19 investigation into the incident. (p6) [PAG]
* Flooding affected Fulmer Lane in Gerrards Cross and led to road closure; the site is the focus of the flood investigation. (p7)
* Road closure shown on the location map (red dotted line) associated with the incident; indicates the lane was made impassable and closed during the event. (p8) [PAG]
* Surface water built up to the west of Fulmer Lane and flowed over Fulmer Lane, then down the embankment onto the M25; flood maps (1 in 100 and 1 in 1000) show depths and the flow path. A road closure is marked on the location map. (p9) [PAG]
* {general}: Surface-water flowed and built up to the west of Fulmer Lane then overtopped the carriageway; the mapped flow path shows water running over Fulmer Lane and down the embankment toward the M25. Flood depth maps predict inundation of the lane in 1:100 and 1:1000 year events. (p10) [IMG, PAG]
* Runoff from a saturated catchment caused surface water to run straight onto the road and into the remaining ditch capacity, producing road flooding and placing nearby built infrastructure at risk. Flood-depth maps (EA, 2013) for the Fulmer Lane area predict surface water depths across the road and adjacent low-lying areas. (p11) [IMG, PAG]
* Heavy rainfall (night of 6â€“7 Feb) combined with heavily silted ditches overwhelmed the drainage system so surface water did not convey along the ditches. Water flowed down the embankment onto the M25 and Fulmer Lane itself flooded; Fulmer Lane was closed during the event for maintenance/ditch works by Transport for Buckinghamshire and the Highways Agency. (p13) [PAG]
* Ditches on Fulmer Lane were heavily silted which contributed to reduced conveyance of surface water away from the M25; Fulmer Lane was closed during the flood event for maintenance works to the ditches. (p14) [PAG]
* Fulmer Lane was flooded due to heavy rainfall and heavily silted ditches along both sides of the road; road flooding occurred. (p18) [TAB]
* Quant: 2 hours or more (road closure) (p7)

### M25 at Gerrards Cross
* Surface water flooding inundated the motorway, causing major disruption and lane closures. (p4) [PAG]
* The M25 was flooded when nearby silted ditches failed to convey surface water away from the area. (p5)
* Flooding affected the M25 motorway near Gerrards Cross, prompting a Section 19 investigation because the incident met the threshold for motorways/trunk roads (significant disruption). (p6) [PAG]
* Flooding on the M25 caused motorway closure that met the investigation threshold for major roads (closure of 2 hours or more), disrupting the motorway. (p7) [PAG]
* {general}: Mapped flow path indicates surface-water running down the embankment from Fulmer Lane onto the M25, implying the motorway corridor could receive overland flood flow during extreme surface-water events. (p10)
* Surface water from overwhelmed drainage and the Fulmer Lane embankment flowed onto the M25 causing lane flooding and lane closures during the event. (p13)
* Surface water conveyance away from the M25 was impeded by silted ditches; the Highways Agency reported lane closures on the M25 during the flood event. (p14) [PAG]
* The M25 was flooded during the event, resulting in lane closures; timings for the lane closures were requested from the Highways Agency but not yet provided. (p15) [PAG]
* Part of the M25 was flooded due to the heavy rainfall. (p18)

### Gerrards Cross
* Area around Fulmer Lane (in Gerrards Cross) experienced standing water/stream flooding in February 2014, evidenced by photographs showing pooled water in vegetation and a temporary bank barrier. (p1)
* The area (Gerrards Cross) experienced surface water flooding on 7th February 2014 affecting Fulmer Lane and the nearby section of the M25, resulting in road closures and drainage failures. (p4)
* Flooding affected locations within Gerrards Cross (notably Fulmer Lane adjacent to the M25), triggering a Section 19 investigation by the LLFA. (p6) [PAG]
* Local flooding impacted the Gerrards Cross area (specifically Fulmer Lane) and contributed to road closures in the locality. (p7) [PAG]
* Fulmer Lane (in Gerrards Cross) was closed during the flood event for maintenance to ditches to address surface water conveyance issues. (p14)
* Quant: 2 hours or more (road closure) (p7) [PAG]

### Buckinghamshire
* County-level flood investigation covers flooding at locations within the county (notably M25 and Fulmer Lane in Gerrards Cross) where standing water in vegetation/stream channels and temporary bank protection were photographed on 7 February 2014. (p1) [IMG, PAG]

### Prestwick Farm
* {general}: The EA surface-water flood map overlays the area including Prestwick Farm, showing shallow to deep predicted inundation in and around farm land and low-lying areas near the farm in the 1:100 and 1:1000 year scenarios. (p10) [IMG]
