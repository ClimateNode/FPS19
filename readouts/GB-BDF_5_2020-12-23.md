## Causeway
* Flood flow is routed down The Causeway (northâ€“south) through Carlton; The Causeway is a primary flow route concentrating floodwater through the village and linking to shaded high-risk areas. (p1) [IMG]
* Two residential properties off The Causeway experienced internal flooding (one had ground-floor standing water, the other had cellar flooding). The road was reported impassable by floodwater and other properties came close to internal flooding. (p2)
* Quant: two residential properties (p2)

## Carlton
* Shaded flood risk areas are concentrated in the central and southern parts of Carlton; water is shown entering from Beeby Way and flowing south along The Causeway, indicating vulnerability to surface-water and fluvial flood flow along these routes. (p1) [IMG]
* Residential properties in Carlton experienced internal flooding (two properties reported internal inundation) and multiple roads (The Causeway, Pavenham Road, Bridgend) were impassable; local responders assisted and a wider major incident was declared in the area. (p2)
* Quant: two residential properties (p2)

## Beeby Way
* {22 Dec 2020, 23 Dec 2020}: Identified on the map as the source flow route: arrows show water flowing from Beeby Way into Carlton, contributing to flood pathways that feed central/southern Carlton flood risk zones. (p1) [IMG]
* Part of the overland flood flow route (runoff from fields to the south formed flows along The Causeway taking runoff from Beeby Way). The junction to Beeby Way was associated with blocked gullies/drains which were later cleared (April 2021). Floodwater contributed to roads becoming impassable in the area. (p2)

## Pavenham Road
* Pavenham Road was reported impassable due to floodwater during the same flood incident affecting Carlton. (p2)

## Bridgend
* Bridgend was reported impassable due to floodwater during the event. (p2)
