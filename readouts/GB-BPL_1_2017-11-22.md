## Place names with coordinates

### Blackpool
* {22 Nov 2017, 23 Nov 2017}: Widespread surface-water flooding reported across the Blackpool and Lancashire area on 22 November 2017, affecting multiple streets and local communities. (p3)
* Town-wide flooding on 22 Nov 2017 affecting multiple streets and infrastructure: specific locations named include Limerick Road and Lockhurst Avenue; major flooding under Devonshire Road Bridge (road closure); Anchorsholme Academy was flooded. The report attributes the flooding to an exceptionally severe storm that overwhelmed highway drainage and sewers. (p4) [IMG, PAG]
* Widespread flooding across parts of Blackpool: property-level flooding (water entering properties largely under the floor), roads flooded (up to around 1m in places), areas impassable (East Anchorsholme across highways), loss of electricity in some areas, sandbags and council response were ineffective in some cases, and water receded the morning of 23rd November 2017. (p7)
* Flooding on 22 November 2017 prompted a Section 19 investigation. Specific properties (noted as Valentia Road and Limerick Road) were identified for potential flood resilience measures; transport disruption occurred at Devonshire Road Bridge; actions proposed include watercourse clearance, surface water management, and partnership improvements for Hillyaide Brook and Royles Brook. (p9)
* {22 Nov 2017, 23 Nov 2017}: Quant: approximately 300 properties (Blackpool and Lancashire) (p3)
* Quant: approximately 300 properties (p4) [IMG, PAG]
* Quant: 74 properties; 6 garages (p7)

### Anchorsholme
* Flooding in the Anchorsholme area caused a number of power failures. (p3) [TAB]
* Anchorsholme Academy was reported to have been subject to flooding on 22nd November 2017. The Anchorsholme area was affected by flooding when highway drainage and the sewer network were overwhelmed; United Utilities recorded stormwater systems (tanks and the Fylde Tunnel sewer) already at full capacity before the storm. (p4) [IMG]
* Anchorsholme pumping station had its pumps called into duty sequentially as tunnel levels rose; the station reached capacity during the extreme rainfall on the night of 22 November 2017, and pump operation was constrained by the start height in the connecting pipe so it could not reduce tunnel levels earlier. (p5)
* Properties in the Anchorsholme area experienced property-level flooding that was investigated by Council officers following the event on 22nd November 2017. (p6) [TAB, PAG]
* Sewage system was full to capacity and ground saturated; sewer surcharge contributed to property and highway flooding; United Utilities diverted flows away from the Anchorsholme catchment which mitigated some flooding; East Anchorsholme (area bounded by Warren Drive, Sevenoaks Drive, Wood Green Drive, North Drive and Snowhills Crescent) was recorded as the largest flooded area and was impassable with highway inundation; water receded on the morning of 23rd November 2017. (p7)
* Anchorsholme pumping station was queried as a possible reason for local flooding; United Utilities reported the pumping station was operational on the evening of 22nd November and that pumps operated intermittently as expected during the event. (p8)

### Valentia Road, Bispham
* Listed by Blackpool Council as having experienced flooding during the intense rainfall event on 22 November 2017; reported to the council as one of the locations affected. (p3) [TAB]
* Evidence of sewer surcharge into properties, flooding over the carriageway and in gardens; water entered properties largely under the floor. Road flooded in parts up to 1m deep and properties suffered electrical disruption. (p7)
* {22 Nov 2017, 23 Nov 2017}: Properties on Valentia Road and Limerick Road were affected by flooding linked to the integrated drainage system being saturated; the connection of Bispham Dyke into the sewer network was identified as a contributing issue and flood resilience investigations were recommended for these properties. (p8)
* Quant: 1m deep (road flooding in parts) (p7)

### Anchorsholme Pumping Station
* Pumps at Anchorsholme were called into duty sequentially as tunnel levels rose; the station reached capacity during the extreme rainfall on the night of 22nd November 2017. The pumping station could not be operated earlier to reduce tunnel levels because the pumps only start once the tunnel level passed the 'station start height'. United Utilities' records show considerable flows arriving at the station in the days leading up to and on 22nd November. (p5)
* {22 Nov 2017, 23 Nov 2017}: High flows arriving at the pumping station triggered automatic operation of additional pumps on the evening of 22nd November and during 23rd November 2017; the station called upon the remaining two pumps. Pump five tripped intermittently during the evening of 22nd November 2017. The station had previously operated pumps to discharge to sea as the system was full. (p6) [TAB, MUL]
* {22 Nov 2017, 23 Nov 2017}: Quant: 5 pumps; 1210 minutes of pumping; 2 additional pumps called into service (p6) [TAB, MUL]

## Topics without coordinates

### United Utilities
* {22 Nov 2017, 23 Nov 2017}: United Utilities attended the flood event on 22 and 23 November 2017 and provided customer support in response to the flooding (including a customer bus in Morrison's car park staffed following the event). (p3) [MUL]
* {22 Nov 2017, 23 Nov 2017}: United Utilities' storm water tanks and sewer system were reported to be at full capacity following steady rain from 20th November 2017 and saturated ground; this contributed to the severe flooding on 22nd November 2017 that affected properties across Blackpool (reported ~300 properties), caused major flooding under Devonshire Road Bridge (road closure) and flooding at Anchorsholme Academy and other streets (e.g. Limerick Road, Lockhurst Avenue). (p4) [PAG]
* Their storm water tanks and the Fylde Tunnel sewer system were at full capacity following steady rain from 20 November 2017; the system was operating at storage limit so pumping/discharge to sea could not occur until storage thresholds were met, requiring continuous monitoring and operation of pumping stations during the event. (p5) [PAG]
* Operated pumping assets and managed beach pumps during the storm; confirmed beach pumps were available and would activate automatically; reported intermittent tripping of pump five on the evening of 22nd November 2017 but stated this did not change the overall severity of the flooding. (p6)
* United Utilities diverted flows from Skipool pumping and surrounding areas away from the Anchorsholme catchment to provide additional sewer capacity; many United Utilities assets were continually spilling storm sewage to watercourses under Environment Agency consents during the storm; the diversion of storm water to the River Wyre is recorded as having mitigated flooding in Anchorsholme. (p7)
* United Utilities' Anchorsholme pumping station was scrutinised during the event; pumps were reported operational on the evening of 22nd November and were operating intermittently during the flood (concerns raised that pumping station performance could have contributed to local flooding such as Mossom Lane). (p8)
* {22 Nov 2017, 23 Nov 2017}: United Utilities' network/operations were implicated in disruption during heavy rainfall and they are engaged in discussions about managing flooding at Devonshire Road Bridge and in partnership work to improve water storage and flow in the Hillyaide Brook and Royles Brook catchments. (p9)
* {22 Nov 2017, 23 Nov 2017}: Quant: approximately 300 properties (p4) [PAG]

### Fylde Tunnel
* The Fylde Tunnel Sewer system was reported to be at full capacity prior to and during the storm, contributing to sewer surcharge and urban/surface water flooding across the area on 22nd November 2017. (p4)
* {20 Nov 2017, 22 Nov 2017}: The tunnel system (including associated storage locations) reached full storage capacity prior to discharge to sea, limiting discharge until thresholds were met and contributing to high flows and pumping stations reaching capacity on the night of 22nd November 2017. (p5) [PAG]
* Quant: approximately 300 properties (p4)

### Chatsworth Avenue Pumping Station
* {20 Nov 2017, 22 Nov 2017}: Pumping stations along the Fylde Coast (including Manchester Square, Anchorsholme and Chatsworth Avenue) were operating in sequence as the Fylde Tunnel reached full storage; the system was under significant stress during the storm and required deployment of UU resources to pumping stations. (p5)
* Due to heavy rainfall and a full system the station pumped out to sea as a flood prevention measure; the station experienced intermittent spilling and operated pumps to discharge flows prior to and on 22nd November 2017. (p6) [TAB]

### Blackpool Council
* {22 Nov 2017, 23 Nov 2017}: Received numerous reports of street flooding from the event on 22 November 2017, activated emergency planning protocols and coordinated on-site response (officers attended the flood event on 22 and 23 November 2017 and remained on site for a number of days). (p3)
* Council officers visited properties reported as flooded, delivered letters to affected properties, deployed sandbags to try to divert water (which proved ineffective where sewer surcharge entered properties under floors) and recorded flooding conditions across the borough during the event. (p7)
* {22 Nov 2017, 23 Nov 2017}: Quant: approximately 300 properties affected (event-wide) (p3)

### Devonshire Road Bridge
* Major flooding beneath the bridge which led to a road closure. (p4)
* {22 Nov 2017, 23 Nov 2017}: The bridge was closed due to flooding during heavy rainfall, causing transport disruption. The bridge has a history of closure in such events and officers are working with United Utilities to investigate and identify measures to reduce future flooding at this location. (p8)
* Flooding at the bridge during heavy rainfall caused continued disruption; discussions have started with United Utilities (and Network Rail) on potential solutions and management of flooding at the bridge. (p9)

### Manchester Square Pumping Station
* {general}: Manchester Square is the start of the Fylde tunnel collection system; it formed part of the sewer network delivering flows into the tunnel during the heavy rainfall that led to the tunnel reaching full storage capacity on 22 November 2017. (p5)
* Reported intermittent spills and pump operation as the system was full; the station pumped out to sea as a flood-prevention measure. (p6) [TAB]

### River Wyre
* United Utilities diverted storm flows to the River Wyre during the event; this diversion is recorded as having mitigated flooding in the Anchorsholme catchment. (p7)

### Bispham Dyke
* Bispham Dyke, a main river, was identified as being connected into the sewer network and therefore contributed to flooding in the local drainage system (notably affecting nearby streets such as Valentia Road and Limerick Road). (p8)

### Hillylaid Brook
* These watercourses (Hillyaide Brook and Royles Brook) were identified as causes of flooding linked to the 22 November 2017 event, prompting investigation and clearance of watercourses and planned projects to improve channel efficiency, increase water storage and consider surface water separation to reduce future flooding. (p9)

### Royles Brook
* These watercourses (Hillyaide Brook and Royles Brook) were identified as causes of flooding linked to the 22 November 2017 event, prompting investigation and clearance of watercourses and planned projects to improve channel efficiency, increase water storage and consider surface water separation to reduce future flooding. (p9)
