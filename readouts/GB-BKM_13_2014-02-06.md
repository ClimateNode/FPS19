## Place names with coordinates

### Windsor Hill, Wooburn Green
* Flooding forced full closure of the road; closure disrupted access and transport through the area. (p4)
* Windsor Hill road was closed due to flooding, causing loss of highway access over the period of the event. (p5)
* Floodwater from the River Wye flowed across fields toward the houses on Windsor Hill, and additional rapid overland flow ran down the steep Windsor Hill, increasing flood risk to properties on the hill. (p14)
* Floodwater from the River Wye flowed across the field and down Windsor Hill. The field filled with water up to waist depth; horses had to be removed. Residents moved cars to safety and pumped water out of front gardens. Water approached houses from the road and the rear; properties had water up to their floorboards and gardens and drives were flooded. The Queen and Albert public house had its cellar flooded. (p15) [PAG]
* Flooding occurred when the River Wye broke its banks upstream of a tree blockage; the adjacent field filled with water up to waist height, horses were removed for safety, residents moved cars to safety, water was pumped from front gardens, and water approached houses from both the road and rear. Properties experienced water up to floorboards and flooding of gardens and drives. The road at Windsor Hill was closed between 07 Feb and 12 Feb 2014 (diary shows repeated closures and reopening). (p16) [PAG, TAB]
* High flows in the River Wye overtopped the right bank due to a tree blockage, flooding a field, the road and reaching a house on the north side of Windsor Hill; roads were impassable and were closed to prevent vehicles driving through deep water. (p17)
* Floodwater overtopped the river bank and flowed into the field, road and up to houses on the north side of Windsor Hill. Residents pumped to keep water from entering properties, properties were surrounded by water, and water reached up to the floorboards in a number of properties. (p21)
* Quant: 2 houses (p4)

### Wooburn Green
* Flooding at Windsor Hill within Wooburn Green caused the Windsor Hill road to be closed for several days; residential properties experienced internal flooding to floorboard level and the public house cellar flooded. (p4)
* Flooding in the Wooburn Green area caused the closure of Windsor Hill (a Class A/B highway) and prompted a formal section 19 investigation by the county authority. (p5) [PAG]
* Flooding from the River Wye affected the Wooburn Green area. The River Wye, which runs through Wooburn Green, splits under Windsor Hill; one channel flows toward the A4094 and the other flows around the eastern boundary then along the southern boundary of the Wooburn Manor Park residential area before rejoining. These channel routes were implicated in the local inundation of the Wooburn Green locality during the event. (p6) [PAG]
* The region of Wooburn Green was flooded, with inundation affecting areas around Wooburn Manor Park and other low-lying areas adjacent to the River Wye's channels. (p7) [PAG]
* Floodwater from the River Wye breached its banks and flowed across the lower-lying fields between the river and the property Salan, inundating those fields and flowing onto Windsor Hill road toward houses on Windsor Hill. Runoff down the steep Windsor Hill road also contributed to flood routing into the settlement. Photographs and resident records document historic inundation along Windsor Hill and the intervening fields. (p13)
* Residents in Wooburn Green experienced flood risk from high river flows; they took measures to protect their property, requested assistance from the EA and TfB/BCC, and the road was closed to prevent vehicles from pushing deep water into houses. (p17)
* Quant: road closed for 5 to 6 days; 2 houses with water up to floorboards; 1 public house cellar flooded (p4)

### River Wye
* The River Wye's channel through the Wooburn Green area split as it passed under Windsor Hill, with flows directed west toward the A4094 and SW around the eastern boundary. During the event these river channels contributed to flooding in the Wooburn Green area (including the area around Wooburn Manor Park). (p7)
* The River Wye burst its banks and flowed across the right bank, across fields and toward the houses on Windsor Hill, delivering floodwater into the built-up area. A fallen tree was mapped on the east bank upstream of the main bridge and may have obstructed flow, exacerbating localized flooding. (p14)
* The River Wye burst its banks when high winter rainfall combined with a channel blockage (a fallen tree) prevented flow. The river broke its banks on the right bank and flowed across the adjacent field towards Windsor Hill, filling the field and causing downstream flooding of properties. (p15) [PAG]
* Very high river levels in early February 2014 (peak around 7â€“8 Feb) combined with a tree blocking the channel caused the river to break its banks on the right bank upstream of the Windsor Hill bridge. This breach sent floodwater into the adjacent field and toward Windsor Hill properties, leading to inundation of gardens, drives and building floor levels and flooding of a public house cellar. (p16) [TAB]
* A tree lodged in the channel upstream of Windsor Hill bridge restricted flow during high flows, causing the River Wye to overtop its right bank; floodwater flowed into the adjacent field, across the road and up to the house on the north side of Windsor Hill. The event was a fluvial (river) flood measured between a 1-in-50 and 1-in-100 year event. (p17)

### Wooburn
* Wooburn Green (part of Wooburn) was flooded; the flood triggered a section 19 investigation and was associated with local transport disruption (Windsor Hill road closure). (p5) [PAG]
* The two River Wye channels rejoin near the SW corner of Wooburn Manor Park and then follow a SW route along the A4094 through Wooburn, causing river flooding along that route through Wooburn. (p7) [PAG]

### Wooburn Manor Park, Wooburn Green
* River Wye channels split after flowing under Windsor Hill and flowed around then along the southern boundary of the Wooburn Manor Park residential area, resulting in flooding of the residential area and adjacent land. (p7)

### Windsor Hill Bridge
* A tree lodged in the River Wye channel upstream of Windsor Hill Bridge blocked flow during high river levels, causing the river to overtop the right bank and send water into the adjacent field, onto the road and up to a house on the north side of Windsor Hill. (p17)
* A tree in the River Wye channel upstream of Windsor Hill Bridge blocked flow; during high flows this caused the river to overtop the right bank and flow into the adjacent field, road and up to houses on the north side of Windsor Hill. Removal of the tree allowed water levels to recede. (p21)

### Queen and Albert
* Cellar of the public house was flooded as river water overtopped/broke its banks and flowed through the adjacent field toward Windsor Hill properties. (p16) [PAG]

### Thames Valley
* Heavy, persistent rain across the Thames Valley in Dec 2013 and Jan/Feb 2014 saturated the land, increasing runoff into the river network and contributing to high river flows that led to local overtopping and flooding during the event. (p21)


## Topics without coordinates

### Environment Agency
* Issued a flood alert for the River Wye on 06 February 2014 (20:30) and later removed the alert (29 Feb 2014 09:04). Residents called the Environment Agency during the flooding but the EA was engaged with other incidents and could not provide immediate response to this incident. (p16) [PAG]
* Involved in investigating and responding to the River Wye blockage that caused overtopping upstream of Windsor Hill; advised enforcement under Section 107 of the Water Resources Act 1991 where main river flow was impeded; promoted resident flood warnings and guidance following flooding that surrounded properties and caused water to reach floorboards on the north side of Windsor Hill. (p21) [TAB]

### Thames Water
* Identified as a stakeholder to be involved in flood-management discussions to maintain sewer service provision and to consider measures (for example return valves on sewer pipes) to prevent foul water entering houses during the Windsor Hill flood incident. (p21) [TAB]

### Transport for Wales
* Windsor Hill road was closed between 6th and 12th February 2014 by TfB/BCC to prevent vehicles driving through deep flood water and to prevent wash from cars into properties at risk. (p21) [TAB]
