## Place names with coordinates

### Buckinghamshire
* Surface-water flooding occurred in and around Bishopstone during the event (24 Dec 2013 - 14 Feb 2014). The southeast of Bishopstone experienced the deepest inundation, with deeper flooding concentrated adjacent to watercourses and ponds (particularly to the south and southeast of the village). Low-lying built-up areas were inundated and properties close to water features experienced inundation consistent with the mapped depths. (p12) [IMG]
* Residents experienced internal flooding of their properties; affected residents contacted Buckinghamshire County Council about the Repair and Renew grant and BCC directed them to Aylesbury Vale District Council who coordinate the grant scheme for the Aylesbury District. (p18)
* Buckinghamshire County Council (BCC) undertook responsibilities arising from the flooding, including ensuring owners of culverts and watercourses are aware of maintenance duties, considering upstream flood alleviation/land management measures, facilitating information sharing with the community, and using enforcement under Section 25 of the Land Drainage Act where landowners failed to maintain watercourses. (p22) [TAB]

### Bishopstone
* {general}: Floodwater covered roads and property access in the village; vehicular access blocked and gated entrances submerged, causing access disruption and road closures. (p1)
* Prolonged above-average rainfall saturated surrounding land and increased surface water flows into highway drainage and main rivers. Unmaintained rivers, undersized culverts and tight river bends caused rivers to overtop; floodwaters used the highway as a secondary flow route. (p4)
* {20 Jul 2007, 24 Dec 2013 - 14 Feb 2014}: Floodwater covered the full width of a rural road, rendering the route impassable (ROAD CLOSED sign deployed). Vehicles were observed driving through standing water and at least one person was seen wading; local transport was disrupted. (p28) [IMG, MUL]

### Aylesbury
* {general}: Flooding covered roads in the Aylesbury area, resulting in road closures and at least one partially submerged vehicle visible, disrupting access and transport. (p1)

### The Rookery
* Surface water flooding during the 24 Dec 2013–14 Feb 2014 event produced the highest predicted (and corresponding observed) depths concentrated at The Rookery and immediately east of the village centre, causing deeper inundation at this location. (p11) [IMG]
* Labelled on the surface-water depth map within the map coverage that the report states matched actual flooding; therefore inferred to have been subject to surface-water inundation (flooding affecting the property/grounds) during the event. (p12) [IMG]

### Model Farm
* Shown on the surface-water depth map within the area where deeper and shallower surface-water flooding was predicted and which the report says matched actual flooding; inferred to have experienced surface-water inundation of land and potentially buildings during the event. (p12) [IMG]


## Topics without coordinates

### Standall's Ditch
* Standall's Ditch (the main river flowing through the southeast of Bishopstone) was part of the village drainage network during the investigated flood incident. The channel through the village has been altered (two right‑angled bends and a culvert under the road were noted), features that were identified in the report as relevant to how water moves through the village and which may have influenced the flooding that prompted the investigation. (p7) [PAG]
* Standall's ditch (the local watercourse) reached capacity due to large quantities of surface water runoff from surrounding fields, causing excess water to flow along and across the highway. Flooding inundated verges and residential gardens, rendered a roughly 400 m length of highway impassible, and in some events led to internal flooding of properties. This behaviour is reported as the cause of the winter 2013/14 (Dec 2013–Feb 2014) flooding in Bishopstone. (p13)
* Heavy winter rainfall caused large volumes of surface runoff from surrounding fields that filled Standall's Ditch to capacity. Once the ditch was at capacity excess water ran onto the highway, which acted as a separate flow path. Highway drainage and the culvert under the road were full to capacity during the event and unable to convey the full volume, and the highway ditches were also at capacity (their capacity reduced by poor maintenance). (p14) [PAG]
* The main river Standall's Ditch breached at a ninety-degree bend as it enters Bishopstone; water escaped the channel and used the highway as a secondary flow path into the village and to the lowest spot, contributing to internal flooding of properties and making the road impassable. (p15) [PAG]
* Standall's Ditch had very high water levels during the events; overgrown vegetation upstream, ninety-degree bends and undersized/blocked culverts caused reduced channel capacity and back‑up of flow, contributing to local flooding in Bishopstone including internal property flooding and road inundation. (p16)
* Standall's Ditch (Standall) flows through Bishopstone and, as a main river (connecting into Scotsgrove Brook), is implicated in fluvial flooding in the area; the Environment Agency is the responsible RMA for flooding from these main rivers. (p18)
* Culverts under access drives (section between A and B) were undersized, reducing the flow capacity of Standall's Ditch, causing water to back up and contributing to the flooding. (p21) [PAG]
* Standall's Ditch (downstream of the culvert) was identified as a contributor to flooding in Bishopstone due to channel obstruction/siltation and a culvert constriction; recommendations include level survey, de-silting/re-grading, channel clearing and investigation of culvert diameter and outfall size. (p22) [TAB]
* Quant: six severe flood events; roughly 400 meters; three events caused internal flooding to properties (p13)
* Quant: at least two properties (p15) [PAG]
* Quant: at least two properties (p16)

### Transport for Buckinghamshire
* TfB closed the only road through Bishopstone on 24th December 2013 and 7th February 2014 due to floodwaters; the closures remained in place for two to three days after each event while flood water subsided. (p15)
* Transport for Buckinghamshire identified culvert constriction issues and recommended/was tasked with surveying the culvert to find diameter reductions, considering increasing culvert outfall size, cleansing gullies and highway drainage, investigating installation and maintenance of a trash screen on the culvert inlet, and ensuring upstream open watercourse maintenance on BCC land to reduce flood risk. (p22) [TAB]
* Quant: two road closures; two to three days (p15)

### Scotsgrove Brook
* Scotsgrove Brook receives flow from Standall's Ditch immediately south of Bishopstone and, as the downstream main river, was part of the drainage system during the village flood incident investigated. It was therefore implicated in the context of the flooding incident affecting Bishopstone. (p7)
* Scotgrove Brook and the connected ditch had high water levels from excessive rainfall; siltation, fallen trees and restricted outfalls downstream reduced conveyance and contributed to backed-up flows and local flooding. (p16)

### Environment Agency
* Environment Agency investigated flooding linked to Standall's Ditch and Scotsgrove Brook during the Bishopstone event and led recommended response actions: surveying levels downstream of the culvert, one-off channel clearing and re-grading/desilting if required, distributing guidance to riparian owners, and considering enforcement under Section 25 of the Land Drainage Act. (p22) [TAB, PAG]

### Transport for Wales
* {general}: Highway drainage and gullies were compromised during the flood event and culvert capacity/restriction contributed to local flooding of the highway and adjacent land; actions recommended include culvert survey (to locate diameter reduction), increasing culvert outfall size to match inlet, gully/highway drainage cleansing, and installing/maintaining a trash screen on the culvert inlet. (p22) [TAB]
