## Place names with coordinates

### Pavenham Road, Chellington
* Overland flow routes and land drains discharge into the Pavenham Road watercourse; water backing up at culverts causes overland flow into the central shaded flood risk area, leading to flooding of adjacent land, roads and nearby properties. (p1)
* Surface water from an adjacent watercourse and land drains backed up when the culvert beneath Pavenham Road was overwhelmed. Floodwater encroached onto properties immediately north and south of Pavenham Road causing internal flooding (water entering via front and back doors), and made Pavenham Road impassable. One property reported damage to floors and carpets; maintenance issues with the culvert and a highway gully contributed to the event. (p2)
* Quant: 2 residential properties; 13 sandbags; 300mm flood depth (p2)

### Carlton
* Map shows Carlton within the mapped flood-risk area where overland flow routes converge and culvert backups can cause water to overflow into adjacent land and infrastructure; roads and properties in the central shaded zone are at risk of inundation from surface water and drainage backup. (p1)
* Local surface water flooding impacted the community: two residential properties experienced internal flooding with damage to floors and carpets; multiple roads (Pavenham Road, The Causeway, Bridgend) were made impassable. The event was driven by heavy rainfall, overwhelmed culvert capacity beneath Pavenham Road and elevated River Great Ouse levels that impeded drainage. (p2)
* Quant: 2 residential properties (p2)

### Bridgend, Chellington
* Pavenham Road, The Causeway and Bridgend were reported impassable due to floodwater. Flooding on Pavenham Road was linked to overtopping/overland flow from the adjacent watercourse/land drains and contributed to property inundation. (p2)

### The Causeway, Carlton
* Reported impassable due to floodwater during the event. (p2)

### River Great Ouse
* {22 Dec 2020, 23 Dec 2020}: Elevated levels in the River Great Ouse prevented the Pavenham Road watercourse from discharging freely, contributing to surcharge of the culvert and overland flow. This contributed to roads becoming impassable and to internal flooding of nearby properties. (p2)
* {22 Dec 2020, 23 Dec 2020}: Quant: 2 residential properties; flood depths up to 300mm; Pavenham Road, The Causeway and Bridgend impassable (p2)
