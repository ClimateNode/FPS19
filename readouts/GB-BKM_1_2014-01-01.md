## Place names with coordinates

### Old Amersham
* {general}: Grassy field and adjacent recreational area were inundated by standing floodwater; water covered a substantial portion of the field and extended into the adjacent landscape, with trees and park features partially inundated. (p1)
* Town experienced elevated river levels and backing up of the River Misbourne after prolonged above-average rainfall and exceptionally high groundwater levels. A culvert flow restriction caused the river to back up; a blockage of a drainage asset produced a secondary flow down the High Street; a riverbank collapse caused property flooding in the town. (p4)
* Internal flooding of business premises and flooding of residential properties within the Old Amersham area. (p5) [PAG]
* The River Misbourne runs west–east through Old Amersham; flood-related issues were recorded within the town including a restricted culvert under The Maltings and a bank collapse near the Jaguar garage that affected the river channel behind houses on the northern side of the High Street and along the southern edge of Barn Meadow Recreation Ground. (p6) [PAG]
* Within Old Amersham the River Misbourne flows through the town and two specific flood-related issues were identified: (A) a culvert underneath The Maltings had its flow restricted; (B) a bank collapse occurred near the Jaguar garage on the A355. These were flagged as the two main areas of concern for the town. (p7) [PAG]
* River Misbourne runs west–east through Old Amersham passing behind houses on the northern side of the High Street and along the southern edge of Barn Meadow. Within the town a culvert under The Maltings had a restricted flow (location A, SU 95599 97438) and there was a bank collapse near the Jaguar garage on the A355 (location B, SU 96533 96984). Highway gullies in Old Amersham connect to the surface water drainage system which discharges to the River Misbourne and the road drainage along the High Street flows into the river. (p8) [IMG, PAG]
* Culvert flow restrictions and bank collapse locations were recorded in the town; highway gullies and the surface water drainage network (owned by TfB) discharge to the Misbourne, linking surface water drainage failure to local flooding in Old Amersham. (p9) [PAG]
* Locations within Old Amersham suffered culvert flow restriction and a bank collapse that obstructed flow through culverted sections beneath the town and contributed to local flooding; highway gullies along the High Street drain into the Misbourne and are connected to surface water drainage that influenced flood routing. (p10) [PAG, IMG]
* {winter 2000/2001, 2003, January–February 2014}: Properties on the High Street were flooded; at least one property flooded internally during the event described in this report (January–February 2014). Basement flooding and flooding to the rear of St Mary's Church occurred in winter 2000/01. Two businesses reported that flood barriers installed after 2000/01 protected their premises during the later event. (p12) [IMG, PAG, MUL]
* {winter 2000/01, 2003, March 2013, August 2013, January–February 2014}: The River Misbourne overtopped/flowed through Old Amersham causing floodwaters to run down the High Street (west to east). Several properties on the High Street were flooded in the winter 2000/01 event (including basement flooding and flooding to the rear of St Mary’s Church). During the January–February 2014 event at least one property on the High Street was flooded internally again; two businesses reported their post-2000/01 flood barriers protected their premises during the 2014 event. A household with a garden backing onto the river reported garden flooding on three prior occasions, including March 2013 and August 2013, with similar river flows down the High Street as observed in the 2014 event. (p13) [PAG, IMG, MUL]
* {07 Feb 2014 - 08 Feb 2014}: Properties in Old Amersham experienced flooding associated with elevated river levels during peaks on 07–08 February 2014. (p17)
* {November 2013 to mid-February 2014, 17 Jan 2014, 06/07 February 2014, 12 Feb 2014}: Prolonged flooding from November 2013 to mid-February 2014 with internal property flooding starting around 17 January 2014 (flap valve lodged open by debris caused river water to back up through a gully and flow east along the High Street). The most severe event began overnight 06–07 February 2014, with several properties along the High Street flooded internally for several days. Culvert flow restrictions and a riverbank collapse contributed to water flowing from the River Misbourne into surrounding areas. Culvert clearing (jetting) from 12 February 2014 and removal of rubble from the flap valve on 18 January 2014 reduced flows and ended further flooding. (p21) [PAG, MUL]
* {general}: Internal flooding of properties in the settlement occurred over several days; remedial clearing of the culvert on and after 12 February 2014 stopped further flooding in Old Amersham. (p22)
* {09 Jan 2014, 15 Jan 2014, 17 Jan 2014, 18 Jan 2014, week of 03 February 2014, 06 Feb 2014 - 07 Feb 2014, 11 Feb 2014 - 12 Feb 2014, 23 Apr 2014}: Culvert flow restriction beneath The Maltings and high river levels caused garden flooding and flooding risk to properties and the High Street. Agencies distributed sandbags and FloodSax to affected properties, removed obstructions, installed a pump and jetted the culvert (substantially restoring flow), responded to a downstream bank collapse with bank restoration, and carried out community support (door‑knocking, flood surgeries). (p24) [TAB, PAG, MUL]
* {06 Feb 2014 - 12 Feb 2014}: Old Amersham was affected by high river levels and a partial flow restriction in a culvert beneath The Maltings that caused local flooding of streets and gardens. Agencies distributed sandbags/FloodSax, jetting of the culvert was carried out (reducing levels and restoring culvert flow), newsletters and multi-agency meetings were organised, and debris/tree removals were undertaken to lower levels. (p25) [PAG]
* Prolonged high river and groundwater levels, a partially restricted culvert under The Maltings and tampering/damage to a flap valve led to water backing up and caused two severe flood events in the town; floodwaters flowed eastward down the High Street and riverbank collapse downstream of the Jaguar garage contributed to the prolonged flooding. (p30)
* Residents and businesses in Old Amersham were affected by flooding from the River Misbourne; recovery support actions (e.g. Repair and Renew grant, business support and business rates relief) and targeted community measures were recommended to assist recovery and reduce future risk. (p31) [TAB, PAG]
* {winter 2013/14 (January–February 2014)}: Properties in Old Amersham were flooded during the winter 2013/14 event, causing damage to homes and businesses and prompting recovery support and grant eligibility. (p33)
* Quant: two or more business premises (p5) [PAG]
* Quant: two locations (culvert flow restriction at The Maltings; bank collapse near Jaguar garage) (p8) [IMG, PAG]
* {winter 2000/2001, 2003, January–February 2014}: Quant: at least one property; two businesses (p12) [IMG, PAG, MUL]
* {winter 2000/01, 2003, March 2013, August 2013, January–February 2014}: Quant: at least 1 property flooded internally; 2 businesses protected by barriers; garden flooded on 3 occasions (including March 2013 and August 2013) (p13) [PAG, IMG, MUL]
* {general}: Quant: 4 residential properties; 5 business premises (p22)

### River Misbourne
* River levels were raised by prolonged rainfall and exceptionally high groundwater; a culvert flow restriction caused the River Misbourne to back up and a riverbank collapse occurred, which led to property flooding. (p4)
* Flow through Old Amersham was physically impeded: the culvert beneath The Maltings had restricted flow and a bank collapse occurred near the Jaguar garage where the channels rejoin, affecting the channel alignment and conveyance through the town. (p6) [PAG]
* Flow through Old Amersham was physically impeded: a culvert underneath The Maltings had a flow restriction (SU 95599 97438) and there was a bank collapse near the Jaguar garage on the A355 (SU 96533 96984). The river route through town (behind houses on the northern side of the High Street and along the southern edge of Barn Meadow Recreation Ground) is described in relation to these failings. (p7) [PAG, IMG]
* Within Old Amersham the river passes behind properties, through a series of culverts and splits into two channels east of the superstore before rejoining. A culvert beneath The Maltings had restricted flow (location A, SU 95599 97438) and there was a bank collapse near the Jaguar garage on the A355 (location B, SU 96533 96984). These issues are identified as key areas of concern along the River Misbourne through the town. (p8) [PAG]
* Culvert flow restrictions and bank collapse were identified in Old Amersham where the Misbourne is culverted through the town; these issues contributed to fluvial flooding risks and affected areas where the channel passes under the highway and adjacent properties. (p9) [PAG]
* Sections of the Misbourne in Old Amersham experienced culvert flow restriction and bank collapse that obstructed channel flow and contributed to local flooding of adjacent areas; the river is culverted through parts of the town and these failures affected flow conveyance. (p10) [PAG, IMG]
* {winter 2000/1, 2003, March 2013, August 2013, January–February 2014}: The River Misbourne produced flows of river water that ran down the High Street, causing garden and property flooding in Old Amersham during multiple events (including winter 2000/1, March 2013, August 2013 and January–February 2014). (p13) [PAG, MUL]
* {November 2013 to mid-February 2014, 17 Jan 2014, 06/07 February 2014, 07 Feb 2014}: The River Misbourne experienced prolonged high water levels from November 2013 to mid-February 2014, with two particularly severe flooding events on/around 17 January and 06/07 February 2014. The high river levels and saturated catchment caused the river and highway drainage to be exceeded, contributed to surface and highway runoff, and a riverbank collapse occurred downstream of the Jaguar garage on 07 February 2014, allowing river water to flow into surrounding areas. Sedimentation and weirs downstream of The Maltings impeded flushing and exacerbated conveyance problems. (p20) [MUL]
* {November 2013 to mid-February 2014, 17 Jan 2014, 06/07 February 2014}: High river levels and high volumes of runoff exceeded the channel and highway drainage capacity; partial culvert blockages and a riverbank collapse caused water to flow from the river into surrounding areas, and contributed to surface and street flooding in Old Amersham. Clearing the culvert (jetting) and bypass pumping restored the river's ability to pass flows and stopped further flooding. (p21) [PAG, MUL]
* High river and groundwater levels led to elevated Misbourne flows; a tampered/damaged flap valve allowed river water to back up and flow east along the High Street, and high river levels prevented return flow through downstream valves. (p23)
* {06 Feb 2014, 07 Feb 2014, 11 Feb 2014, 12 Feb 2014}: The river experienced high levels and flow restriction in a culvert beneath The Maltings that contributed to flooding of the High Street and gardens; actions included tree removal, bank repairs after a collapse, pump installation and jetting of a restricted culvert which restored flow and lowered water levels. (p24) [TAB, PAG, MUL]
* {January–February 2014, 02 Jul 2014, Mid-July 2014}: Partial flow restriction in a culvert under The Maltings on the River Misbourne caused flooding of Old Amersham High Street and garden flooding; bank collapse downstream of the Jaguar garage required multi-agency restoration and pollution protection, tree removal and culvert jetting reduced water levels and restored flow; later multi-agency meetings and an agreement in principle to remove weirs were held to reduce future culvert restrictions. (p25) [PAG, MUL]
* Weirs and culvert flow restrictions on the Misbourne were identified as contributing to increased flood risk; a multi‑agency meeting (2 July 2014) led to agreement in principle (mid‑July 2014) between the Environment Agency and riparian owners to remove weirs to reduce flooding risk. (p26) [TAB]
* High river levels driven by prolonged rainfall and high groundwater caused backing-up of water, contributed to flow down the High Street and prevented return flow through downstream valves, contributing to prolonged flooding in Old Amersham. (p30)
* The River Misbourne caused flooding/flow restrictions affecting Old Amersham; obstructions, vegetation and culvert restrictions on the Misbourne contributed to flooding risk and led to recommended vegetation clearance, culvert inspection, trash screens and broader flood management actions. (p31) [TAB, PAG]
* The River Misbourne overtopped/caused flooding in winter 2013/14 (January–February 2014), flooding properties in Old Amersham and prompting recovery actions. The event led to requirements for culvert and gully inspections, clearance of vegetation and debris, installation of trash screens on culverts, and coordination between RMAs and riparian owners to reduce blockages and restore flow. (p33) [PAG]
* Quant: 4 residential properties; 5 business premises (p23)

### High Street, Old Amersham
* A blockage of a drainage asset caused a secondary flow down the High Street, producing flooding of the street. (p4)
* {winter 2000/1, 2003, March 2013, August 2013, January–February 2014}: Properties along the High Street were inundated by flows of river water. Several properties flooded in winter 2000/1; at least one of those properties was flooded internally again during the January–February 2014 event. A garden backing onto the Misbourne flooded on three occasions prior to 2014 (including March 2013 and August 2013). Two businesses reported that barriers installed after 2000/1 protected their premises during the January–February 2014 event. (p13) [PAG, MUL]
* {March 2013, August 2013, January–February 2014}: Garden of a household backing onto the River Misbourne was flooded; flows of river water ran down the High Street from west to east during flood events, matching the flows witnessed in the main report event. (p14) [PAG, MUL]
* High Street gullies designed to discharge to the River Misbourne were partly blocked with sediment and were largely unable to discharge at full capacity because of high water levels in the Misbourne, reducing highway drainage capacity and contributing to surface water/urban flooding of the highway and surrounding area. (p20)
* {17 Jan 2014, 06/07 February 2014, 12 Feb 2014}: Water backed up from the River Misbourne through a gully (near the Methodist Church) and flowed east along the High Street, flooding the carriageway and above the kerb line. Water entered the basement of the Elephant and Castle pub on and after 17 January 2014. Temporary defences were moved on 17 January, hampering attempts to redirect flows. The overnight event of 06–07 February 2014 caused internal flooding of properties on the High Street that persisted for several days until culvert clearing and bypass pumping reduced upstream levels. (p21) [PAG, MUL]
* {general}: Properties along the High Street were flooded internally and remained flooded for several days; business activity was indirectly affected by disruption to parking and pavement usage by customers. (p22)
* Water from the River Misbourne backed up and flowed eastward down the High Street; highway drainage was overwhelmed. Business activities were indirectly affected by impacts to parking and pavement use by customers. (p23) [PAG]
* {17 Jan 2014, 18 Jan 2014, 05 Feb 2014, 06 Feb 2014}: Experienced flooding related to a culvert flow restriction and high river levels: properties at risk were given sandbags/FloodSax, an obstruction to a flap valve was removed which ended the bulk of the High Street flooding, and council/agency door‑knocking and assistance were undertaken. (p24) [TAB, PAG, MUL]
* {06 Feb 2014 - 12 Feb 2014}: High Street experienced flooding caused by a culvert flow restriction on the Misbourne; removal of an obstruction ended the bulk of flooding. A pump was installed to alleviate flooding, debris was cleared from the garden of one High Street property, door-knocking and sandbag/FloodSax distribution were used to protect and update residents. (p25) [PAG]
* Water from the River Misbourne backed up through a tampered/damaged flap valve and flowed eastward down the High Street; high river levels also prevented floodwater on the High Street returning to the river through downstream valves. (p30)
* High Street experienced drainage and gully flow restrictions associated with the January–February 2014 floods; remedial actions included scheduled jetting of drains and prioritised repairs to restore highway drainage capacity. (p31) [TAB, PAG]
* {winter 2000/1, 2003, March 2013, August 2013, January–February 2014}: Quant: at least one property; two businesses; three occasions (p13) [PAG, MUL]
* {17 Jan 2014, 18 Jan 2014, 05 Feb 2014, 06 Feb 2014}: Quant: one High Street property (garden cleared) (p24) [TAB, PAG, MUL]
* {06 Feb 2014 - 12 Feb 2014}: Quant: one property; 200 sandbags (p25) [PAG]

### The Maltings
* The culvert underneath The Maltings had its flow restricted and was identified as a primary area of concern during the investigation of the January–February 2014 flooding in Old Amersham. (p7) [PAG]
* {August 2013, January–February 2014}: The Maltings culvert was identified as a possible restriction and under-capacity during high flows; its siphon design encourages debris build-up immediately downstream, contributing to high water levels. EA Operations attended to remove debris; a local resident entered the culvert to remove debris, placing themselves in danger. Two downstream weirs and collected silt further impeded flow. (p14) [MUL]
* The culvert beneath The Maltings was partly restricted during the event, reducing flow conveyance and contributing to elevated local water levels and drainage problems in Old Amersham. (p19) [PAG]
* The culvert located under The Maltings had its flow partly restricted, which prevented rapid discharge of river water, caused backing up of flow at the culvert and reduced the drainage system's ability to convey additional flows, contributing to local flooding. (p20) [PAG]
* {general}: A partial flow restriction in the culvert underneath The Maltings was identified as the primary cause of upstream flooding; EA installed bypass pumping and jetted the culvert (clearing the obstruction) starting 12 February 2014, after which no further flooding occurred. (p22) [MUL]
* Culvert under The Maltings was partially restricted during high river levels, causing water to back up and impeding flow. (p23)
* {18 Jan 2014, 10 Feb 2014, 11 Feb 2014, 12 Feb 2014}: Investigation found a partial flow restriction in the culvert under The Maltings that contributed to flooding of the High Street and adjacent gardens; subsequent jetting of the culvert restored flow and substantially reduced water levels. (p24) [TAB, MUL]
* The culvert under The Maltings was partially restricted, causing river water to back up and contributing to prolonged flooding in Old Amersham. (p30)

### Jaguar Garage
* A bank collapse was reported close to the Jaguar garage on the A355 (location identified as an area of concern where the river channels rejoin). (p7)
* {general}: On 07 February 2014 a section of riverbank downstream of the Jaguar garage collapsed, causing water to back up and flood the Jaguar garage workshop; the collapse was repaired the same day and a boom installed to prevent pollution as on-site oil tanks came close to being overtopped. A fallen tree at the location further restricted flow and raised river levels. (p22)
* A section of the riverbank downstream of the Jaguar garage collapsed and a fallen tree downstream of the garage further impeded river flow, worsening flooding. (p23)
* {07 Feb 2014}: Bank collapse occurred downstream of the Jaguar garage, prompting multi-agency intervention to restore the bank and deploy pollution prevention measures; tree removal downstream lowered water levels and assisted relief of local flooding. (p24) [TAB, PAG]
* {07 Feb 2014}: A river bank collapse occurred downstream of the Jaguar garage during high river levels; multi-agency work (CDC, Bucks Fire and Rescue, tenant farmer and EA) restored the bank and the EA deployed a boom to prevent pollution. A tree removal downstream lowered water levels locally. (p25)
* A section of the riverbank downstream of the Jaguar garage collapsed during the high river levels, contributing to flooding issues. (p30)
* {general}: Quant: 1 garage workshop (p22)

### Amersham
* {general}: Residential area affected by floodwater extending across the landscape; trees are partially submerged and houses are visible behind the inundation, indicating floodwater reached into residential zones. (p1)
* In Old Amersham the River Misbourne had two identified failings: a culvert underneath The Maltings where flow was restricted (SU 95599 97438) and a bank collapse near the Jaguar garage on the A355 (SU 96533 96984). These issues affected river conveyance through parts of Old Amersham (behind houses on the north side of the High Street, along the southern edge of Barn Meadow recreation ground and through culverted sections), contributing to flood-related concern in the town. (p7) [PAG, IMG]
* {07 Feb 2014, 08 Feb 2014}: Old Amersham experienced property flooding during the high-flow peaks on 07–08 February 2014. Local river levels in Amersham are strongly influenced by culverts, natural restrictions and blockages, so the upstream Little Missenden gauge (≈2.6 km upstream) only provides an indication of the local high water conditions that led to property flooding. (p18) [PAG, MUL]
* {November 2013 to mid-February 2014, 17 Jan 2014, 06 Feb 2014 - 07 Feb 2014}: Old Amersham experienced a prolonged period of flooding (Nov 2013 to mid‑Feb 2014) with particularly severe events on 17 Jan 2014 and 06–07 Feb 2014. Saturated catchment and heavy rainfall produced large runoff that, together with high River Misbourne levels, exceeded the capacity of the river and highway drainage. Local drainage assets were flow‑restricted: the culvert under The Maltings was partly restricted; High Street gullies were partly blocked with sediment and largely unable to discharge because of high Misbourne levels; downstream weirs and sedimentation impeded flushing and contributed to backing up of water and reduced culvert outflow. A riverbank collapse on 07 Feb 2014 downstream of the Jaguar garage allowed river water to flow into surrounding areas. Overall the drainage infrastructure could not adequately convey additional surface and highway runoff. (p20) [MUL]
* River Misbourne flooding affected Old Amersham during the January–February 2014 event, causing flow restrictions in culverts and prompting recommendations for vegetation management, culvert remediation and coordinated RMA action. (p31) [TAB, PAG]

### Buckinghamshire
* {January-February 2014}: The county area experienced a flood event in January–February 2014 that prompted a formal Flood Investigation Report; the report analyses conditions at the time, condition of features and watercourses, what happened, possible causes and incident response. (p2)
* Old Amersham (in Buckinghamshire) experienced flooding during the January–February 2014 event; the report investigates that flooding and provides recommendations to Risk Management Agencies to prevent a repeat. (p3) [PAG]
* {January–February 2014, 06 Feb 2014 - 07 Feb 2014, 11 Feb 2014 - 12 Feb 2014}: High river levels and restricted culvert flow caused flooding of gardens and flooding of the High Street in Old Amersham, with some properties reporting internal flooding. Emergency actions included removal of an obstruction to a flap valve (ending the bulk of High Street flooding), distribution of sandbags and FloodSax to at-risk properties, installation of a pump to alleviate culvert-related flooding, jetting of a restricted culvert which lowered water levels (300mm on 11/02 and a further 300mm on 12/02) and restored most flow, removal of a tree which lowered levels by 100–150mm, and repair work after a bank collapse downstream of the Jaguar garage (river bank restored using Hippo bags and a boom deployed to prevent pollution). Residents were advised on financial support and exemptions following reports of internal property flooding. (p24) [TAB, MUL]
* Localised flooding in Old Amersham (High Street) from a culvert flow restriction on the River Misbourne led to property protection actions (sandbags, FloodSax), pump installation, door‑knocking and resident communications; a bank collapse downstream of the Jaguar garage was repaired and pollution controls deployed; jetting of the culvert substantially lowered water levels over 11–12 February and restored flow through the culvert. (p25)

### Little Missenden
* {07 Feb 2014 - 08 Feb 2014, 08 Mar 2014}: Telemetered river gauge at Little Missenden recorded exceptionally high river levels during the winter 2013–2014 event; the entire event is ranked number 1 of the top 10 recorded levels at this site. Peaks occurred on 07–08 February 2014 (coincident with much of the property flooding in the area) and the highest peak was recorded on 08 March 2014. (p17) [PAG, MUL]
* {07 Feb 2014 - 08 Feb 2014, 08 Mar 2014}: The Little Missenden gauge recorded record-high river levels during the event; readings show the event ranked as number 1 of the top 10 levels at this site and indicated major peaks that coincided with property flooding in the area. (p19) [PAG, IMG, MUL]
* {07 Feb 2014 - 08 Feb 2014, 08 Mar 2014}: Quant: number 1 of the top 10 recorded levels at the gauge (p17) [PAG, MUL]
* {07 Feb 2014 - 08 Feb 2014, 08 Mar 2014}: Quant: 459 mm peak level on 08 March 2014; ranked 1 of top 10 recorded levels (p19) [PAG, IMG, MUL]

### Mill Lane, Old Amersham
* A TfB culvert at Mill Lane was identified as part of the chain of culverts subject to flow restriction during the January–February 2014 event, requiring inspections and potential remediation to reduce future flood risk. (p31) [TAB, PAG]
* Culverts in the stretch from Mill Lane to the culvert under the A413 were implicated in the flooding response: they were identified for increased inspection and maintenance and for cleansing to remove blockages affecting highway drainage. Actions specified include inspections of culverts ≥900mm, jetting of drains and gullies and prioritised repair of detected flow restrictions to reduce recurrence. (p32)

### Church Street, Old Amersham
* {17 Jan 2014}: Backed-up river water re-entered the River Misbourne at the gullies near Church Street; flooding along the High Street persisted until flows could rejoin at these gullies, contributing to inundation of the carriageway and pavement edges. (p21)

### Barn Meadow
* {August 2013, 13 Aug 2013, 15 Aug 2013, 23 Aug 2013}: Riverbank damage alongside Barn Meadow on both sides of the River Misbourne noted after flooding in August 2013; EA advised repair works would require agreement (Method Statement) and recommended natural recovery; damage was linked to vehicle access across the river/riverbank and was raised in EA correspondence following high flows. (p14) [MUL]
* {November 2013}: High river levels caused flooding to a section of Barn Meadow and affected some gardens backing onto the River Misbourne; this was identified as problematic from November 2013. (p21)
* {22 Nov 2013, January–February 2014}: High river levels were observed in Barn Meadow during the winter–spring 2013/14 episode and were reported as part of the investigations and local warnings, contributing to flood risk for adjacent gardens and properties. (p24) [TAB, MUL]

### River Misbourne
* {winter 2000/2001, 2003, January–February 2014}: Predicted surface-water flood depths and extents are concentrated along the river channel in the 1:100 and 1:1000 maps; the river corridor is associated with inundation of low-lying areas and the town centre and with property/basement flooding events recorded in winter 2000/01 and during the event described in this report. (p12) [PAG, MUL]
* Above-average prolonged rainfall and exceptionally high groundwater raised river levels; tampering or damage to a flap valve caused water from the river to back up and flow eastward down the High Street, and high river levels prevented return flow through downstream valves, contributing to prolonged flooding in Old Amersham. (p30)

### St Mary's Church
* {winter 2000/1}: Flooding occurred to the rear of St Mary's Church during the winter 2000/1 flood event. (p13) [PAG]

### Elephant and Castle
* {17 Jan 2014}: Basement of the pub was flooded when river-backed surface water flowed down the High Street and overtopped kerbs, with internal flooding occurring on and after 17 January 2014. (p21)


## Topics without coordinates

### Environment Agency
* {August 2013, 13 Aug 2013, 15 Aug 2013, 23 Aug 2013}: Responded to high river levels and flooding on the River Misbourne (August 2013): attended site on multiple occasions to remove debris from the Maltings culvert using rakes and other physical means; attempted inspections of the culvert (CCTV inspection deferred until lower flows); investigated causes of high water levels (heavy/prolonged rain, culvert restriction/under-capacity, siphon design, downstream weirs, accumulation of waste and failing footbridge parts); sent emails to Amersham Town Council about riverbank damage alongside Barn Meadow; advised that riverbank repairs require an agreed Method Statement and should be left to recover naturally; issued a written warning to the resident alleged to have caused bank damage and warned that further breaches of byelaws could lead to investigation/enforcement; advised that any temporary bridge for machinery access would require Flood Defence Consent. (p14) [MUL]
