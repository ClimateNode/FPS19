## Place names with coordinates

### Chesham
* The rainfall-accumulation radar for 20 September 2014 shows very high, localized rainfall over Chesham and its immediate west/southwest surroundings. This heavy accumulation is presented as part of a Flood Investigation Report for Chesham, indicating the intense rainfall was linked to flooding that was investigated. Specific impacts to properties, infrastructure or people are not detailed in the provided context. (p1) [IMG]
* On 20 September 2014 intense rainfall caused surface water runoff and increased flows in the River Chess and its tributary the Vale Brook. In parts of the town these increased flows exceeded the capacity of infrastructure (notably the Vale Brook culvert), resulting in flooding of parts of Chesham. (p4)
* An intense rainfall event produced surface water runoff and markedly increased flows in the River Chess and its tributary the Vale Brook. In parts of town the increased flow exceeded the capacity of infrastructure (notably the Vale Brook culvert), causing internal flooding to residential properties (including basements). (p5) [PAG]
* Multiple areas within the town experienced property flooding during the incident (areas A, B and C are highlighted as locations where residential and business properties flooded). (p8) [IMG, PAG]
* Town centre was affected by flooding driven by the Vale Brook receiving surface water from much of Chesham's urban area and limited channel capacity; flood and surface-water risk prompted mapping of fluvial and surface water flood extents in the town centre. (p10) [IMG, PAG]
* Surface water flooding affected an extensive area of the town during the investigated event, with residential and commercial streets within the town shown to be at risk; a band of fluvial flooding also occurred along the River Chess in the south of the town. The valley topography funnelled runoff towards the Vale Brook and the River Chess, concentrating flows through low-lying parts of Chesham and increasing flood impacts. (p12) [IMG, PAG]
* {1903, 1912, 1915, 1916, 1918, winter 2000/1, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2013/4}: Repeated flooding of the town: surface water and river/ordinary watercourse flooding affected streets and properties; rising groundwater caused Bury Pond to overspill and flood properties; roads experienced extensive and prolonged flooding and artesian wells flowed during high groundwater periods. (p13) [IMG, PAG, MUL]
* {2013/4}: Surface-water flooding has occurred across Chesham with notable incidents: property flooding on Broad Street/Berkhampstead Road in 2006; flooding in Pednormead End and The Spinney and commercial properties along the High Street in 2008; rising groundwater caused Bury Pond to overspill and flood properties in Pednormead End; and during the winter of 2013/4 there are records of internal flooding to properties on Pednormead End, Brushwood Road and Harding Road, with Berkhampstead Road and Broad Street also affected. (p14) [PAG]
* {2013/4, 20 Sep 2014}: Chesham experienced intense, localised storm rainfall overnight 19–20 September 2014 (radar indicated ~30–40 mm near the High Street and >50 mm near Pednormead End), producing surface-water/flash-flood conditions in the town. Separately, during winter 2013/14 the town suffered internal property flooding: six properties were recorded flooded internally on Pednormead End, Brushwood Road and Harding Road; Berkhampstead Road and Broad Street were also affected by flooding that winter. (p15) [PAG, MUL]
* A very localised, intense overnight storm (19–20 Sept 2014) produced heavy rainfall over the town; radar shows highest accumulation over Chesham (particularly High Street and Pednormead End neighbourhoods). The intense rainfall caused rapid rises in local watercourses (see Vale Brook) and contributed to acute urban/flash flooding conditions in the town. Water levels rose and fell quickly in response to the storm. (p16) [IMG, PAG]
* Intense, short-lived rainfall caused surface water to exceed slot drain capacity in the southern High Street and Market Square; flooding covered the full width of those areas for short periods. Vale Brook culvert manholes within at least three shops along the High Street and Broadway surcharged. The event resulted in internal flooding to properties across the town (both residential and commercial), with shallow ingress into many shops (approximately 2–5 cm and a few metres inward). (p19) [PAG]
* At least 34 properties were flooded internally (5 residential properties and 29 businesses). Town-centre shops were generally flooded from the street-facing front for a few metres with shallow depths of about 2–5 cm; some properties were flooded from the rear via East Street. Businesses reported loss of floor-level stock, damaged carpets and reduced trading while cleaning and repairing. The culverted Vale Brook capacity was exceeded, causing backing up of water through manholes and preventing rapid drainage of surface water. (p20) [PAG, MUL]
* An intense, highly localised rainfall event (approx. 03:00–05:00) produced widespread surface water flooding across Chesham. Up to around Pednormead End and the town centre the event led to overwhelmed drainage, backed-up culverts/manholes, and surface water entering properties; property owners cleaned floors, removed damaged carpet tiles and used dehumidifiers. Surface water had largely drained away by about 06:00, and no immediate multi-agency incident response occurred because agencies were unaware until the following Monday. (p21) [PAG]
* The town experienced flooding on 20 September 2014; a number of issues contributed to the event (including problems associated with the Vale Brook culvert). (p25)
* The town experienced flooding that affected town-centre drainage and highways; recommendations and a Flood Alleviation Scheme were proposed to manage fluvial and surface-water flood risk arising from the 20 September 2014 event. (p27) [TAB, PAG]
* Town centre experienced surface water/urban flooding related to blocked or restricted highway drainage and culverts (Vale Brook culvert inspected by EA CCTV). Flooding affected areas including the High Street and Market Square; recommendations made to cleanse gullies, repair drainage and review temporary defences. (p28) [PAG]
* The town experienced flooding associated with the investigated event (20 September 2014). Community and local authority response actions are recorded: residents were advised to sign up for Environment Agency Floodline warnings, to document and report flood incidents to Chiltern District Council, Buckinghamshire County Council and the Environment Agency, and the Chesham Flood Action Group coordinated local response and support. (p29) [TAB, PAG]
* Quant: five residential properties within 1km2 (p5) [PAG]
* {1903, 1912, 1915, 1916, 1918, winter 2000/1, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2013/4}: Quant: Five artesian wells flowing; six properties (p13) [IMG, PAG, MUL]
* {2013/4}: Quant: six properties (p14) [PAG]
* {2013/4, 20 Sep 2014}: Quant: 6 properties (p15) [PAG, MUL]
* Quant: at least 34 properties; 5 residential properties; 29 businesses; at least 3 shops with culvert manholes surcharged (p19) [PAG]
* Quant: 34 properties; 5 residential properties; 29 businesses; 5 properties in Market Square; 18 properties along the High Street; 2 properties on The Broadway; 4 properties on Broad Street (p20) [PAG, MUL]

### Pednormead End, Chesham
* Residential properties in the Pednormead End area flooded during the incident; Pednormead End is identified as Area A where several residential properties flooded. (p8) [PAG]
* {1918, winter 2000/1, 2006, 2013/4}: Major flooding recorded around Pednormead End and Church Street (historical events); properties have been flooded by overspill from Bury Pond (groundwater-driven) and by an ordinary watercourse adjacent to Missenden Road; Pednormead End was among locations with internally flooded properties in winter 2013/4. (p13) [MUL]
* {general}: Bury Pond has overspilled (exacerbated by rising groundwater) and flooded properties in the Pednormead End area; the ordinary watercourse adjacent to Missenden Road has also caused flooding of properties there. During winter 2013/14 six properties along Pednormead End (and adjacent roads) were flooded internally. (p14)
* {2013/4, 20 Sep 2014}: Pednormead End was one of the streets where internal property flooding was recorded during winter 2013/14 (part of the set of six properties flooded internally). Radar data for 19–20 September 2014 also indicates very high local rainfall (>50 mm) in the Pednormead End area. (p15) [PAG, MUL]
* Properties on Pednormead End were flooded; this flooding may have been caused by water backing up upstream of the River Chess culvert under Missenden Road. (p19)
* Internal flooding affected properties around Pednormead End. (p20) [PAG]
* Area upstream of a restricted culvert experienced elevated flood risk; a Pednormead End flood-alleviation project (2015–2018) was continued to reduce upstream flooding caused by the restricted culvert under Missenden Road. (p28)
* {1918, winter 2000/1, 2006, 2013/4}: Quant: Six properties (p13) [MUL]
* {general}: Quant: six properties (p14)
* {2013/4, 20 Sep 2014}: Quant: 6 properties (p15) [PAG, MUL]
* Quant: 3 properties (p19)
* Quant: 3 properties (p20) [PAG]

### High Street, Chesham
* Flooding of mainly business properties in the town centre — flooding extended from Market Square along High Street north to The Broadway. (p8)
* {2008}: Commercial properties along the High Street were flooded by surface water in 2008. (p14)
* Culvert manholes located within shops on the High Street and Broadway surcharged during the event, indicating the culvert capacity was exceeded; at least one Broadway shop reported a tidemark from flooding although water had dissipated by the time the occupier arrived. (p18)
* The slot drains on the southern High Street were overwhelmed: surface water exceeded slot drain capacity, flowed overland southward for about an hour, and the largest extent covered the full width of the High Street between ~04:54 and 05:13. At least three Vale Brook culvert manholes located within shops along the High Street and The Broadway surcharged. Eighteen properties along the High Street were flooded; most shop inundation was shallow (approximately 2 to 5 cm) and extended a few metres into premises. (p19) [PAG]
* Surface water was channelled along the High Street by its levels and camber; the capacity of surface water drainage was exceeded causing a backup of surface water at ground level. A pipe beneath the High Street (approx. 300mm) was noted as possibly affecting drainage capacity if blocked. (p21)
* High Street's highway drainage capacity and state of repair were identified as concerns after the flooding; improvements to drainage and maintenance were recommended to reduce surface-water/urban flooding impacts observed during the 2014 event. (p27) [TAB]
* Quant: at least 3 shops (p18)
* Quant: 18 properties; at least 3 manholes surcharged; depth approximately 2 to 5 cm (p19) [PAG]

### The Broadway, Chesham
* Flooding affected The Broadway as the northern extent of business/property flooding that ran along the High Street from Market Square. (p8)
* Vale Brook culvert manholes located within at least three shops along the High Street and Broadway surcharged during the event, indicating culvert capacity was exceeded. CCTV showed surface water exceeding the capacity of slot drains (southern High Street) and gullies (Market Square), producing overland flows for about an hour; a shop on Broadway recorded a tidemark and reported the water had dissipated via the surface water drainage system by about 06:00. (p18)
* Surface water entered properties from the street-facing front causing internal shallow flooding similar to other town-centre shops; impacts included wet flooring, some stock damage and cleanup/repairs where applicable. (p20)
* Quant: at least 3 shops (p18)
* Quant: 2 properties (p20)

### Market Square, Chesham
* Mainly business properties flooded originating at Market Square and extending along the High Street north to The Broadway (identified as Area B). (p8)
* CCTV showed surface water flooding in Market Square exceeding the capacity of the slot drain on the eastern edge and the western gullies; peak ponding occurred around 05:00 and dissipated by 06:00. The rainfall caused compaction of sand around the newly replaced Vale Brook culvert and subsequent collapse of brick pavers at the surface (culvert performance unaffected). (p18)
* Surface water drainage capacity was exceeded: slot drains/gullies overflowed, producing ponding that peaked around 05:00 and dissipated by ~06:00. Five properties in Market Square were flooded. The rainfall also compacted sand around a recently replaced culvert, causing collapse of brick pavers at the surface, though culvert performance was not affected. (p19) [PAG]
* Surface water entered shops from the street-facing front causing internal shallow flooding; businesses reported some floor-level stock loss, damaged carpets and reduced trading hours while cleaning and drying took place. (p20)
* Market Square experienced surface-water drainage problems tied to the 2014 flooding; the report recommends identifying further improvements (in connection with works completed in 2014) to reduce surface-water flooding risk. (p27) [TAB]
* Quant: 5 properties (p19) [PAG]
* Quant: 5 properties (p20)

### Broad Street, Chesham
* Property flooding occurred along Broad Street during the incident. (p8)
* {general}: Notable surface-water/urban flooding of properties occurred in 2006 along Broad Street (together with Berkhampstead Road); Broad Street was also affected by flooding during the winter 2013/14 period. (p14)
* Properties were flooded internally, mainly by water entering from the street-facing front; two properties on the east side (at the St Mary's Way roundabout) were flooded by water entering from the rear. Impacts included stock water damage, carpet replacement and cleanup operations. (p20)
* Quant: 4 properties; 2 properties from the rear at St Mary's Way roundabout (p20)

### Buckinghamshire
* {1903, 1912, 1915, 1916, 1918, winter 2000/2001, 2006, 2007, 2008, winter 2013/2014}: Multiple historical flood incidents in Chesham (within Buckinghamshire) affected roads, properties and local infrastructure: Vale Brook and a highways drainage ditch have overtopped and routed floodwater into the town centre, resulting in properties being flooded; surface-water flooding affected Broad Street/Berkhampstead Road (2006), The Spinney and commercial properties along the High Street (2008), Germain Street and Hivings Hill; fishing lakes off Cresswell Road overflowed in 2007; rising groundwater and Bury Pond overspill have caused or worsened flooding around Pednormead End; winter 2000/01 included extensive road flooding along Vale Road and five artesian wells flowing; winter 2013/14 saw six properties flooded internally on Pednormead End, Brushwood Road and Harding Road, with Berkhampstead Road and Broad Street also affected. (p13) [IMG, MUL]
* {24 Sep 2014, 08 Oct 2014, 10 Oct 2014}: Properties in Chesham (within Buckinghamshire) were affected by flooding on 24 September 2014 and on 8 and 10 October 2014; county-level authorities carried out surveys and organised a FloodSmart event in response. (p22) [PAG, MUL]
* {1903, 1912, 1915, 1916, 1918, winter 2000/2001, 2006, 2007, 2008, winter 2013/2014}: Quant: six properties; five artesian wells (p13) [IMG, MUL]
* {24 Sep 2014, 08 Oct 2014, 10 Oct 2014}: Quant: 4 businesses (p22) [PAG, MUL]

### Church Street, Chesham
* {1918, winter 2000/1, 2006, 2013/4}: Major flooding recorded around Pednormead End and Church Street (historical events); properties have been flooded by overspill from Bury Pond (groundwater-driven) and by an ordinary watercourse adjacent to Missenden Road; Pednormead End was among locations with internally flooded properties in winter 2013/4. (p13) [MUL]
* One property on Church Street was flooded internally during the event as part of the wider surface water/urban flooding in town. (p19)
* {1918, winter 2000/1, 2006, 2013/4}: Quant: Six properties (p13) [MUL]
* Quant: 1 property (p19)

### Berkhampstead Road, Chesham
* {1903, 1912, 1915, 1916, winter 2000/1, 2006, 2013/4}: Repeated road flooding along Vale Road and Berkhampstead Road has occurred historically, with roads becoming extensively and prolongedly flooded and providing routes for floodwater into the town, affecting access and adjacent properties. (p13) [MUL]
* {general}: Berkhampstead Road experienced notable surface-water/urban flooding of properties in 2006 (with Broad Street) and was also affected during the winter 2013/14 flooding. (p14)

### Missenden Road, Chesham
* {general}: An ordinary watercourse adjacent to Missenden Road has caused flooding of properties in Pednormead End. (p14)
* The River Chess culvert located under Missenden Road is known to be of insufficient capacity during extreme events; this culvert's limited capacity was implicated as a potential cause of water backing up upstream during the event, contributing to flooding in the vicinity. (p19)
* A restricted culvert under Missenden Road was identified as causing flow restrictions that led to upstream flooding; culvert condition was part of CCTV inspection and targeted for remedial works as part of flood-alleviation measures. (p28)

### Germain Street, Chesham
* {general}: Germain Street and Hivings Hill are regularly affected by surface water flooding (road flooding). (p14)
* One property on Germain Street was flooded internally during the event as part of the town-wide surface water/urban flooding. (p19)
* Quant: 1 property (p19)

### Townsend Road, Chesham
* A temporary logger at the Vale Brook culvert on Townsend Road recorded the watercourse responding to the intense overnight rainfall: water levels rose rapidly and reached the highest recorded since the logger was installed. The Vale Brook at this culvert rose to around 500 mm depth (the channel usually runs dry), showing a rapid rise and fall consistent with a flash-flooding pulse. (p16) [PAG]
* A temporary logger at the entrance to the Vale Brook culvert recorded the highest water levels since monitoring began during the 20 September 2014 event. The typically dry watercourse rose rapidly and fell quickly, reaching a substantial depth at the culvert entrance. (p17) [IMG, PAG]
* Quant: around 500 mm water depth (p16) [PAG]

### East Street, Chesham
* Highway drainage on East Street was overwhelmed, causing surface water to flow downhill into the rear of properties on the east side of the High Street and contributing to internal flooding of those properties. (p20)
* The capacity of the highway drainage on East street was exceeded, causing surface water to flow downhill to the rear of properties on the east side of the High Street. (p21)
* Quant: 4 properties (p20)

### Vale Road, Chesham
* {1903, 1912, 1915, 1916, winter 2000/1, 2006, 2013/4}: Repeated road flooding along Vale Road and Berkhampstead Road has occurred historically, with roads becoming extensively and prolongedly flooded and providing routes for floodwater into the town, affecting access and adjacent properties. (p13) [MUL]
* {general}: Extensive and prolonged road flooding occurred along Vale Road; a highways drainage ditch on the east side of Vale Road has on occasion reached capacity and overtopped onto the road, providing a direct route for flood water into the centre of Chesham and resulting in flooding of properties. (p14)

### Brushwood Road, Chesham
* {2013/4}: During the winter 2013/14 event, properties on Brushwood Road and Harding Road were flooded internally (part of a group of six properties flooded internally along Pednormead End, Brushwood Road and Harding Road). (p14)

### Harding Road, Chesham
* {2013/4}: During the winter 2013/14 event, properties on Brushwood Road and Harding Road were flooded internally (part of a group of six properties flooded internally along Pednormead End, Brushwood Road and Harding Road). (p14)
* {2013/4}: Quant: six properties (Pednormead End, Brushwood Road and Harding Road) (p14)

### High Street, Chesham
* Surface water entered shops (mostly via the street-facing front) causing internal shallow flooding (typically 2–5 cm and a few metres into shops). Some properties on the east side were flooded from the rear via East Street. Businesses reported loss of floor-level stock, replacement of damaged carpets and reduced trading hours to clean up. (p20) [PAG]
* Quant: 18 properties; 4 properties from the rear via East Street (p20) [PAG]

### Cresswell Road, Chesham
* {general}: The fishing lakes off Cresswell Road overflowed during a 2007 flood event, causing flooding from the lakes. (p14)

### The Spinney, Chesham
* {general}: In 2008 surface-water flooding affected The Spinney and commercial properties along the High Street. (p14)

### Higham Mead, Chesham
* {general}: Higham Mead experienced flooding that has been attributed in part to contributions from the Vale Brook. (p14)

### Hivings Hill, Chesham
* {general}: Germain Street and Hivings Hill are regularly affected by surface water flooding (road flooding). (p14)

### Bury Pond
* {general}: Rising groundwater levels affected Bury Pond causing it to overspill; the overspill flooded properties in the Pednormead End area and there is recorded flooding of the road alongside Bury Pond. (p14)

### Chesham Moor
* {general}: Artesian groundwater emergence was recorded during the flood event: five artesian wells were flowing on Chesham Moor (indicating groundwater emergence associated with flooding). (p14)


## Topics without coordinates

### Vale Brook
* On 20 September 2014 intense rainfall caused increased flow in Vale Brook which exceeded the capacity of the Vale Brook culvert, contributing to flooding in parts of Chesham. (p4)
* {general}: Vale Brook has contributed to flooding in the Higham Mead area; upstream drainage ditches have on occasion reached capacity and overtopped, sending floodwater down the road into the town and causing property flooding. (p13) [PAG]
* {general}: The Vale Brook has contributed to flooding in the Higham Mead area of Chesham (its flows have been a causal factor in local flooding). (p14)
* The Townsend Road logger on the Vale Brook recorded the highest water levels since monitoring began in 2011 during the 20 Sept 2014 storm. The normally dry watercourse rose to around 500mm at the culvert entrance, showing a rapid spike and subsequent fall in levels in direct response to the intense overnight rainfall. (p16) [PAG]
* The Vale Brook culvert exceeded capacity and surcharged; culvert manholes located within shops along the High Street and Broadway surcharged during the event. The Market Square section of the Vale Brook culvert experienced surrounding sand compaction from the rainfall, leading to collapse of surface brick pavers (culvert performance remained unaffected). (p18)
* The culverted Vale Brook's capacity within the town centre was exceeded, causing water to back up through manholes and preventing rapid draining of surface water from the town centre. (p21)
* Issues with the Vale Brook culvert were identified as contributing to the flooding that affected Chesham on 20 September 2014. (p25)
* Culvert blockages and structural issues in the Vale Brook main river culvert (including the restricted culvert under Missenden Road) were identified as contributing to flooding risk; the EA conducted a CCTV survey and actions to address blockages/structural issues were recommended. (p27) [TAB]
* Quant: ~500mm water depth at Townsend Road logger (p16) [PAG]
* Quant: at least 3 shops (p18)

### River Chess
* Fluvial flooding from the River Chess produced a band of flood risk through the south of Chesham and contributed to flooding of adjacent low-lying areas during the investigated event. (p12) [PAG]
