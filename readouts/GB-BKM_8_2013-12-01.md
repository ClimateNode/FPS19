## Place names with coordinates

### Hedgerley Lane, Beaconsfield
* Carriageway heavily waterlogged with multiple large puddles and standing water; potholes and muddy, uneven surface indicating drainage failure and impaired road usability. (p1)
* Thames Water sewers surcharged (after Pyebush Lane pumping station was turned off and groundwater infiltrated pipes), discharging contaminated water from manholes onto Hedgerley Lane. The road became impassible to vehicles and on foot, creating environmental and public health risks and cutting off access to nearby properties including a care home and a nursery. (p4)
* {December 2013 - January 2014, February 2014, March 2014}: Surface water inundation affected Hedgerley Lane (predicted to flood in a 1 in 30 year event); the January 2014 flood (beginning of January) was the worst on record at this location and is described as probably a combination of surface water flooding and foul sewer surcharge. Further floods occurred in February and March 2014. (p9) [PAG, MUL]
* {December 2013 - January 2014, 31 Dec 2013, 14 Jan 2014, 16 Jan 2014}: The foul sewer surcharged and contaminated floodwater covered the road, making it impassable. Contractors tankered the water day and night until tankering stopped on 14 Jan 2014, after which contaminated water collected on the road. Thames Water cleared the floodwater on 16 Jan 2014 and completed road decontamination the following week. (p11) [PAG, MUL]
* Foul sewer on Hedgerley Lane surcharged (due to extreme/prolonged rainfall combined with the closure of the Pyebush Lane pumping station), flooding the lane with contaminated (sewage) water; the road was covered, access to cut-off properties was made almost impossible, and the event posed an environmental and public health risk. Report states properties were not flooded internally. (p16) [TAB]
* {December 2013 - January 2014, 31 Dec 2013, 14 Jan 2014, 16 Jan 2014}: Quant: 9-12 inches (flood depth) (p11) [PAG, MUL]

### Beaconsfield
* Surface water flooding affected a road in Beaconsfield (Hedgerley Lane), resulting in standing water and waterlogged road conditions. (p1)
* Flooding on Hedgerley Lane within Beaconsfield caused by pumping station closure and groundwater infiltration led to surcharging of sewers and contaminated discharge onto the road, making it impassible, creating environmental and public health risks, and isolating properties (including a care home and nursery). (p4)
* Local area (including Hedgerley Lane) experienced surface water flooding combined with foul sewer surcharge; the early January 2014 event was described as the worst on record and led to repeated flooding at the location afterwards. (p9) [PAG, IMG]
* {December 2013 - January 2014, 31 Dec 2013, 04 Jan 2014, 16 Jan 2014}: Within Beaconsfield a broken foul sewer and the closure of the Pyebush Lane pumping station led to contaminated sewer floodwater covering Hedgerley Lane and making routes impassable. Local impacts included assistance required to access Harrias House care home (4 Jan 2014) and the closure of a nursery on 16 Jan 2014 to avoid children walking through contaminated water. Road decontamination was completed the week after 16 Jan 2014. (p11) [MUL]
* {December 2013 - January 2014, 31 Dec 2013}: Contaminated flood water in the area led South Bucks District Council environmental health to close a nursery on 16 January 2014 to prevent children walking through contaminated water and bringing it into buildings; SBDC staff were on site throughout the flooding to provide advice. (p12)
* {December 2013 - January 2014, 31 Dec 2013, 04 Jan 2014, 16 Jan 2014}: Quant: 9-12 inches (flood depth) (p11) [MUL]

### Gregories Road, Beaconsfield
* A broken foul sewer was reported in Gregories Road during the flood event; this sewer failure contributed to downstream operational impacts (closure of the Pyebush Lane pumping station). (p10)
* {December 2013 - January 2014, 31 Dec 2013}: A broken foul sewer occurred in Gregories Road on 31 Dec 2013; this failure led to the closure of the Pyebush Lane pumping station and contributed to downstream sewer surcharge and flooding. (p11) [PAG, MUL]
* {December 2013 - January 2014, 31 Dec 2013}: A broken sewer in Gregories Road caused contaminated flood water which led to the closure of the Pyebush Lane pumping station and required tanker removal of contaminated flood water. (p12)

### Pyebush Lane, Beaconsfield
* The Pyebush Lane pumping station was turned off for a period, which prevented normal removal of flows. This contributed to Thames Water pipes being overwhelmed (with groundwater infiltration noted), leading to surcharging out of manholes and contaminated floodwater on Hedgerley Lane that made the road impassable and posed environmental and public health risks, cutting off access to properties including a care home and a nursery. (p4)
* {December 2013 - January 2014, 31 Dec 2013}: The Pyebush Lane pumping station was closed (from 31 Dec 2013) because of the broken sewer and associated flows; tankers were used to manage flows at the pumping station but capacity was exceeded due to groundwater and surface water infiltration, contributing to sewer surcharge elsewhere. (p11) [PAG, MUL]

### Harrias House Residential Care Home
* Access to the care home was impeded because Hedgerley Lane was flooded by contaminated foul sewer water (a broken foul sewer and closed Pyebush Lane pumping station caused the foul sewer to surcharge). Staff required off-road transport to reach the building. (p11)
* Quant: 9-12 inches (p11)


## Topics without coordinates

### Thames Water
* Thames Water responded by using tankers after the pumping station closure, but groundwater infiltration into their pipes produced volumes they could not manage; pipes surcharged out of manholes on Hedgerley Lane, causing contaminated floodwater that made the road impassable, created environmental and public health risks, and cut off access to properties including a care home and a nursery. (p4)
* Thames Water reported a broken sewer in Gregories Road which led to the Pyebush Lane pumping station being closed for the duration of the flood event. (p10)
* {December 2013 - January 2014, 31 Dec 2013}: Thames Water reported the broken foul sewer, closed the Pyebush Lane pumping station, deployed tankers and contractors (Flowline) to manage and remove contaminated floodwater, and took actions on 16 Jan 2014 to clear floodwater and complete decontamination. (p11) [PAG]
* {December 2013 - January 2014, 31 Dec 2013}: Closed the Pyebush Lane pumping station on 31 December 2013 due to a broken sewer in Gregories Road; arranged tanker removal of contaminated flood water via sub-contractor Flowline (site presence 4 January 2014 to 14 January 2014) operating day and night; reported infiltration of ground and surface water exceeded tankering capacity; operation constrained by topography (access only with small tankers) and limits on vehicle numbers; 24-hour tankering stopped on 14 January 2014 and Thames Water is thought to have attended site on 16 January 2014 to resolve the issue. (p12)
* The organisation's pumping station closure contributed to a foul sewer surcharge that resulted in contaminated flooding of Hedgerley Lane. (p16) [TAB]

### Pyebush Lane Pumping Station
* {December 2013 - January 2014, February 2014, March 2014}: Failure of the Pyebush Lane pumping station led to foul sewer surcharge that contributed to local flooding, including the severe event in early January 2014 (described as the worst on record); pumping-station failure has caused floods in this location in previous years and contributed to floods in Febâ€“Mar 2014. (p9) [PAG, MUL]
* The Pyebush Lane pumping station was closed for the duration of the flood event, indicating direct operational disruption of sewer/pumping services. (p10)
* {December 2013 - January 2014, 31 Dec 2013}: The Thames Water pumping station at Pyebush Lane was closed on 31 Dec 2013; tankers were deployed to manage flows at the station but capacity was exceeded due to groundwater and surface water infiltration, contributing to surcharging of the foul sewer on Hedgerley Lane. (p11) [MUL]
* {December 2013 - January 2014, 31 Dec 2013}: Pyebush Lane pumping station was closed on 31 December 2013 because of a broken sewer in Gregories Road; pumping station levels required tanker removal of contaminated flood water and the site was subject to ongoing operational intervention to keep levels down. (p12)
* Closure of the pumping station contributed to the foul sewer surcharging that flooded Hedgerley Lane with contaminated sewage. (p16)
