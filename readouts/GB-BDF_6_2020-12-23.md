## Place names with coordinates

### Bedford
* {23 Dec 2020 - 24 Dec 2020, 25 Dec 2020}: Wider-area flooding led Bedford Borough Council to declare a major incident on 25/12/2020; LLFA, Bedford Flood Response Team and volunteers visited properties on 28/12/2020 to carry out impact assessments and assist with recovery/clean up. (p2)

### the Marsh, Carlton
* Internal flooding of at least one residential property on The Marsh (ground floor flooded, furniture damaged). A second property was close to flooding but residents dug a trench to divert water westwards around the property into the northern ditch system. (p2)
* Quant: 1 residential property; 75mm across the ground floor (p2)

### School Lane, Carlton
* Flows from School Lane are conveyed into the ditch network and contribute to overland surface-water flood routes, influencing downstream flooding pathways. (p1) [IMG]
* Heavy rainfall formed an overland flood flow route down School Lane (about 600 m south of The Marsh), which discharged into a ditch feeding the piped/open ditch system toward The Marsh. (p2)

### Turvey Road, Carlton
* Overland flood flow routes are shown crossing Turvey Road, with flows moving southeastward across the road toward lower-lying areas; properties along Turvey Road are indicated as potentially impacted by these flows. (p1) [IMG]
* Runoff discharged into a ditch along Turvey Road; the ditch is piped beneath Turvey Road and continues east of St Mary’s Church as an open ditch toward The Marsh. A partially blocked trash screen upstream of the piped system is thought to have caused water to back up across an adjacent field toward properties, contributing to flooding. (p2)

### Marsh Farm
* The overland flood flow routes originate/move from the Marsh Farm area southeastward; the flooding incident is noted to have occurred off the marsh. A proposed bund is positioned near Marsh Farm to intercept or redirect these overland flows to reduce downstream impacts. (p1) [IMG]
