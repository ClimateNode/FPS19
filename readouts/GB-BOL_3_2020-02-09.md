## Place names with coordinates

### Riverside Drive, Prestolee
* Internal flooding of properties at Riverside Drive; flood depths reached around 1 metre in some properties. (p3)
* On 9th February 2020 floodwater affected Riverside Drive (a residential area in Prestolee) and Smiths Road (mixed residential and commercial). Flooding inundated streets and premises, causing property flooding and localised disruption to access and use of the roads and buildings. (p6) [IMG]
* {26 Dec 2015}: Internal flooding of residential properties due to River Irwell overflowing on 26th December 2015. (p13) [PAG]
* Inundation caused siltation of highway gullies; gullies required cleaning after the flood event. (p14) [PAG]
* {general}: High silt levels in highway drainage gullies due to inundation of material during river flooding; gullies were cleaned after the flood. (p15) [PAG]
* During the flood the River Irwell rose and back-filled the surface water sewer outfall serving Riverside Drive, causing water to issue from highway gullies and resulting in flooding of the highway before the river overtopped its bank. Debris (a rolled-up section of chain link fencing) was found trapped at the sewer outfall hindering discharge; the outfall brickwork showed structural damage likely from impact by floating debris. (p16)
* Floodwaters from the River Irwell spilled onto Riverside Drive (via the left bank), depositing a sandy mix of debris with a high proportion of man-made material on the embankment and making the embankment marginally stable; the road and adjoining embankment were directly affected by the river flooding. (p17) [PAG]
* River water spilled onto Riverside Drive via the left bank during the storm, resulting in flooding affecting the Riverside Drive community. (p18)
* The River Irwell at Riverside Drive swelled and flooded into its floodplain, inundating property. A Forward Incident Officer was deployed to the street on 9th February to door-knock and advise evacuation; some residents evacuated while others remained. Follow-up visits and support occurred on 10th February, some families were displaced and alternative accommodation arranged. Neighbourhood Services carried out external clean-up, removing debris and river silt; highway drainage gullies received heavy silt input and were cleaned on 10th February; additional waste collections were provided. (p19)
* Riverside Drive has a structurally impaired surface water outfall implicated in flooding/backflow; a flood defence project is being developed and reconstruction of the outfall is recommended to reduce flood risk to properties. (p21) [TAB]
* The surface water outfall at Riverside Drive is structurally impaired, contributing to flooding risk and allowing potential backflow into the drainage system during flood events; this has led RMAs to recommend reconstruction of the outfall and consideration of non-return valves to reduce property flooding. (p22) [PAG]
* Quant: around 1 metre depth in some properties; 25 properties; 5 businesses (Irwell and Croal) (p3)
* {26 Dec 2015}: Quant: 36 properties (p13) [PAG]

### Smith's Road, Darcy Lever
* Internal flooding of properties and businesses at Riverside Drive and Smiths Road as part of the event. (p3)
* On 9th February 2020 floodwater affected Riverside Drive (a residential area in Prestolee) and Smiths Road (mixed residential and commercial). Flooding inundated streets and premises, causing property flooding and localised disruption to access and use of the roads and buildings. (p6) [IMG]
* Map identifies a flood location at the downstream edge of the catchment upstream of Smiths Road, indicating river flooding occurred at or immediately upstream of the area near Smiths Road. (p11) [IMG]
* Properties on Smiths Road were flooded during the event, identified as the flooded properties approximately 1 km upstream of the Croal monitoring station. (p12)
* {14 Jun 2002, 26 Dec 2015}: Internal flooding of residential properties and businesses during the 26th December 2015 Storm Eva event; there is also a recorded flooding incident at this location on 14th June 2002. (p13) [MUL]
* {14 Jun 2002, 26 Dec 2015}: Historic flooding events at this location include Boxing Day 26th December 2015 (due to Storm Eva) when five residential properties flooded internally and two businesses flooded internally. There is also a recorded flood at this location on 14th June 2002. (p14) [MUL]
* Highway drainage performed poorly during the flood, with gully gratings having become proud of the carriageway and the sag point served by only a single gully, reducing interception and flow capacity; gullies needed resetting and additional capacity to intercept water during the event. (p17)
* Flooding from the River Croal at Smiths Road caused inundation of properties on/around Smiths Road. (p19)
* Road drainage performed poorly during the event, prompting recommendations to replace old gullies and gratings, install additional gully connections/kerb drainage at sag points, and consider measures to reduce overflow into adjacent properties. (p21) [TAB]
* Surface water and sewer-related flooding affected properties at Riverside Drive and Smiths Road, with overflow risk into private property (specifically risk of overflow into the vehicle access and into no. 3 Smiths Road). The locations experienced issues with potential backflow from surface water/sewer outfalls during flood events. (p22)
* Quant: 25 properties; 5 businesses (Riverside Drive and Smiths Road) (p3)
* {14 Jun 2002, 26 Dec 2015}: Quant: 5 residential properties; 2 businesses (p13) [MUL]
* {14 Jun 2002, 26 Dec 2015}: Quant: 5 residential properties; 2 businesses (p14) [MUL]

### River Irwell
* The Rivers Irwell and Croal produced fluvial flooding after significant rainfall on saturated ground, causing internal flooding to nearby properties and businesses. (p3)
* River Irwell rose to a very high level on 9 February 2020; the monitoring station at Kearsley recorded 5.33 m at 14:45, the second highest level since records began (2012), indicating significant river flooding at Kearsley. (p12)
* {20 Sep 1946, 26 Dec 2015, 09 Feb 2020}: Raised river levels led to flooding reported to property (flood warning issued for the River Irwell at Prestolee and Ringley Bridges on 9 Feb; historical river overtopping at Prestolee caused internal property flooding in earlier events). (p13) [MUL]
* The River Irwell rose and flooded over its banks; rising river levels filled the surface water sewer system at the outfall serving Riverside Drive, causing backflow into highway gullies and resulting in highway flooding before the river bank was overtopped. Floating debris from the river impacted and damaged the brickwork outfall structure. (p16)
* The River Irwell overtopped/impacted its embankment adjacent to Riverside Drive, leaving a sandy mix of debris (including man‑made material) on the embankment and contributing to marginal embankment stability and downstream flooding of Riverside Drive. (p17)
* The River Irwell at Riverside Drive swelled and overtopped into its floodplain, inundating property. Flood Alert and Flood Warning were issued for the Irwell (Prestolee and Ringley) with a targeted Flood Warning issued at 09:05 and the first warning threshold crossed at 10:30 on the day. (p19) [PAG]
* River levels on the Irwell prompted issuance of a Flood Alert and a Flood Warning for the Prestolee/Ringley area; the first Flood Warning threshold was crossed (indicating river flooding impacting the community). The Environment Agency carried out post-event river works (sediment removal) and assessed temporary defences and feasibility of a flood wall. (p20)
* Quant: 25 properties; 5 businesses; around 1 metre depth in some properties (Irwell and Croal) (p3)
* {20 Sep 1946, 26 Dec 2015, 09 Feb 2020}: Quant: 36 properties; 9 properties; 5 residential properties; 2 businesses (p13) [MUL]
* Quant: 81 properties (within GM25 Flood Warning Area); 74 properties potentially received the flood warning; 52 properties fully registered with Floodline; 22 properties via Extended Direct Warnings service (p20)

### River Croal
* The Rivers Irwell and Croal produced fluvial flooding after significant rainfall on saturated ground, causing internal flooding to nearby properties and businesses. (p3)
* The River Croal reached high levels on 9 February 2020; the Moses Gate monitoring station recorded 1.31 m at 13:30, a level likely to be among the five highest since 1948. The station is approximately 1 km downstream of properties on Smiths Road that were flooded. (p12)
* The River Croal at Smiths Road swelled and flooded into its floodplain, inundating property; river silt was deposited in highway gullies requiring cleaning after the event. (p19)
* Quant: 25 properties; 5 businesses; around 1 metre depth in some properties (Irwell and Croal) (p3)

### Prestolee
* The Prestolee community experienced internal flooding of properties and businesses as part of the fluvial flood event. (p3)
* Prestolee is identified as the suburb containing Riverside Drive, which was flooded on 9th February 2020; therefore flooding impacted this locality (at least at the Riverside Drive location). The extract does not provide further locality‑wide impact details. (p6)
* {20 Sep 1946, 26 Dec 2015, 09 Feb 2020}: Flood warning issued for the River Irwell at Prestolee and Ringley Bridges on 9th February 2020; reports of flooding to property occurred from approximately 12:45pm on 9th February 2020. Previously, River Irwell overflowed at Prestolee causing internal flooding at the Irwell Bank Spinning Company (20th September 1946) and on 26th December 2015 (36 properties on Riverside Drive and 9 properties on the opposite bank at Stoneclough Rise). (p13) [MUL]
* Prestolee was specifically targeted by the Flood Warning issued for the Prestolee/Stoneclough/Ringley community; the EA Flood Resilience team maintained contact with the community during the event to provide real-time forecasting and information. (p20)
* Quant: 25 properties; 5 businesses (p3)
* {20 Sep 1946, 26 Dec 2015, 09 Feb 2020}: Quant: 36 properties; 9 properties (p13) [MUL]

### Bolton
* Flooding affected Smiths Road (area of mixed residential and commercial use to the south east of Bolton centre); included in the investigation of the 9th February 2020 event. (p6) [IMG]
* {14 Jun 2002, 26 Dec 2015}: Flooding on 26th December 2015 (Storm Eva) affected properties in Bolton (Smiths Road: internal flooding). (p13) [MUL]
* {14 Jun 2002, 26 Dec 2015}: Quant: 5 residential properties; 2 businesses (p13) [MUL]

### Kearsley
* Flooding affected Riverside Drive (residential area in Prestolee / Kearsley). The report is an investigation into flooding that took place on 9th February 2020 at this location. (p6) [IMG]
* The Kearsley area experienced significant river flooding associated with the River Irwell on 9 February 2020 when river levels at the local gauging station reached 5.33 m (recorded at 14:45), the second-highest since monitoring began. (p12)

### Ewood Bridge
* {2015}: In 2015 a sudden uncontrolled collapse of a River Irwell weir near Ewood Bridge during high flows coincided with a rapid shift in the upstream river channel, causing major channel movement and damage. (p18)

### Stoneclough Rise, Prestolee
* {26 Dec 2015}: Internal flooding of properties on the opposite riverbank at Stoneclough Rise caused by River Irwell overflow during the 26th December 2015 event. (p13)
* {26 Dec 2015}: Quant: 9 properties (p13)

### East Lancashire Railway
* {2015}: The 2015 collapse and associated channel shift removed a large part of the East Lancashire Railway line embankment, damaging the railway infrastructure. (p18)

### River Roch
* Upstream catchments of the Rivers Roch and Croal received very high rainfall (more than the February monthly average in 24 hours), contributing to river levels rising and downstream flooding into floodplains that inundated property. (p19)

### Hacken Bridge
* Listed as the downstream extent of the affected stretch where surface water/urban flooding and inadequate carriageway drainage (old gullies/gratings) contributed to ponding and local drainage failures along the route. (p21) [TAB]


## Topics without coordinates

### Bolton Council
* Carried out a Section 19 investigation into the flooding that occurred in Prestolee on 9th February 2020 and published the results as the Lead Local Flood Authority. (p5)
* As Highway Authority, carried out surveys and cleaning of highway gullies after the flood due to siltation caused by inundation during the flood event. (p14)
* The Council's Civil Contingencies team responded to Flood Warnings and deployed officers to impacted locations (including Riverside Drive) to advise evacuations and provide support. Council teams carried out clean-up of external areas, removal of debris and river silt, arranged additional waste collections, and had highway drainage gullies cleaned following heavy silt input. The Council worked with the Environment Agency and United Utilities to support affected communities and investigate the event. (p19)

### Environment Agency
* The Environment Agency issued the Flood Alert and Flood Warning for the River Irwell at Prestolee/Ringley, had its Flood Resilience team in contact with the local flood group throughout the event providing real-time forecasts, supported community engagement (including organising a post-event drop-in), and carried out operational works (sediment removal, assessment of temporary defences and spraying invasive species) to support response and appraisal of future flood risk measures. (p20)
* Quant: 81 properties (within GM25 Flood Warning Area); 74 properties potentially received the flood warning; 52 properties fully registered with Floodline; 22 properties via Extended Direct Warnings service (p20)

### United Utilities
* United Utilities' assets were involved: the Riverside Drive foul drainage pumping station was partially submerged by the flooding (risking outage and pollution). United Utilities reported the pumping station performed with no issues on 9th February except for a short-duration incoming power failure due to an Electricity North West supply interruption. (p14)
* Responded to the flood by undertaking a CCTV survey of the local sewer network (no defects/operational issues found) and removed the debris trapped in the surface water sewer outfall within 24 hours of notification. United Utilities had previously raised control equipment in the Riverside Drive pumping station following the 2015 flood, which ensured the asset remained resilient during this flood. (p16)
* Identified risk of river/backflow into surface water sewer outfalls at Riverside Drive and Smiths Road and recommended examining installation of non-return valves to prevent backflow into the system; noted a structurally impaired surface water outfall at Riverside Drive requiring consideration of reconstruction to address flooding issues. (p21) [TAB, PAG]

### Riverside Drive Pumping Station
* Partially submerged by the flood and sited within the flood zone making it vulnerable to outage and pollution; the installation nevertheless performed during the 9th February 2020 event. (p14)
* The foul pumping station is described as susceptible to flooding and not sited above the 1-in-200-year flood level. Alterations made by United Utilities after the 2015 flood (raising control equipment within the kiosk) ensured the asset remained resilient and operational during the 9 February 2020 flood. (p16)

### Irwell Bank Spinning Company
* {20 Sep 1946}: Internal flooding occurred at the Irwell Bank Spinning Company when the River Irwell overflowed at Prestolee. (p13)

### Prestolee Weir
* {2013, 09 Feb 2020}: The weir was in a significant state of disrepair and was removed as part of the Environment Agency's programme; its condition/removal (weir situated ~450 m upstream of Prestolee Bridge and ~500 m from the Riverside Drive spill point) was cited by a resident as having a possible influence on recent flooding at Riverside Drive. (p17) [MUL]
