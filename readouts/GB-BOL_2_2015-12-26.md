## Place names with coordinates

### Rochdale
* Town-centre street and the ground floors of multiple businesses were inundated; water reached up to doors and windows of shopfronts and partially submerged street furniture (traffic lights and pedestrian posts), disrupting access to the commercial area. (p1) [IMG]
* Parts of Salford and Rochdale experienced very deep flooding on 26 December 2015 as rivers responded rapidly to heavy, prolonged rainfall on saturated ground; depths in places were sufficient that some residents had to be evacuated by boat. (p13)
* Part of the Irwell/Roch catchment area affected by the 26 December 2015 heavy precipitation which led to very rapid river level rises on Boxing Day; catchment precipitation contributed to river flooding and unusually high peak river levels recorded during the event. (p14) [TAB]
* River levels on the Roch and tributaries in the Rochdale area reached their highest recorded levels on Boxing Day (26 December 2015), causing river flooding at multiple local stations and across the borough. (p15) [TAB, PAG]
* Rochdale experienced widespread internal property flooding, predominantly from main river flooding with additional surface-water impacts across the town and vicinity. (p17) [TAB, PAG]
* Flooding affected Rochdale (specifically Littleborough and Rochdale), inundating properties; a scheme has been proposed to assess options for reducing flood risk in the area. (p20) [IMG]
* Severe local flooding damaged electrical infrastructure (two substations) including flooding of a substation control room to 1.5 m depth causing extensive equipment damage; a hydroelectric plant adjacent to Rochdale bus station was damaged. Large numbers of properties in Rochdale lost power. (p21)
* Flooding closed the transport interchange (tram and bus terminus) in Rochdale town centre on Boxing Day (reopened the next day), disrupted tram and bus services, caused loss of power affecting many traffic signals, and flooded Rochdale Council's town centre office (affecting computer servers and communications). Rochdale wastewater works suffered flooding (damage described as minimal) and local pumping infrastructure was affected. (p22)
* {26 Dec 2015, 27 Dec 2015, 29 Dec 2015}: Parts of Rochdale lost water supply or experienced reduced pressure after flood-related damage to telemetry at a service reservoir; power failures caused by floodwaters prevented Water Treatment Works being run on-site immediately. (p23) [MUL]
* On 26 December 2015 the River Roch catchment and adjacent watercourses were subject to the Boxing Day flood response: properties adjacent to the River Roch and Hey Brook were issued with direct flood warnings and local defences were recorded as providing protection. (p26) [TAB]
* River flooding on the River Roch caused structural damage: a flood wall completely failed at a residential Care Home next to the River Roch at Littleborough (in the Rochdale area); minor repairs on other walls and embankments on the River Roch at Rochdale and Littleborough were programmed; RMAs carried out inspections and held community engagement events. (p27) [PAG]
* Flooding damaged walls/embankments on the River Roch; walls were sandbagged immediately after the flood and wall rebuilding was included in an emergency repair programme (work started 14 March 2016, due mid-June 2016). Minor repairs on other walls/embankments in the area were also programmed. (p28)
* Internal flooding of properties in the town centre and vicinity; evacuations reported. (p29)
* River flooding on 26 December 2015 affected Littleborough and Rochdale (including town centre and Wardleworth). Damage included collapse of a length of flood defence behind Riverside Care Home (repair scheduled/underway) and widespread impacts that led to an extended flood‑risk project: construction of a second flood storage basin on the Calder Brook near Littleborough, modelling/computer simulations for River Roch, and investigations of measures such as raising defence walls, additional flood storage, altered reservoir operation and natural flood management. (p32) [TAB]
* Map shows clusters of properties affected in 1 km x 1 km grid squares near Rochdale following the same event; some grid squares in the area are shown in colour categories corresponding to 20–99 affected properties (and higher categories visible elsewhere on the map). (p88) [IMG]
* Widespread internal flooding of properties across the borough from multiple sources (rivers, surface water, groundwater and sewers); extent of damage to habitable spaces and businesses being assessed; many cellar floods noted. (p113) [IMG, PAG]
* Littleborough and parts of Rochdale suffered river flooding; Littleborough was one of the worst-affected areas with deep internal flooding. (p114)
* Communities in this area were affected by the Boxing Day floods and received ongoing support: a pre-existing community resilience programme (Defra Flood Resilience Community Pathfinder) and continued National Flood Forum partnership provided post-flood support; the Council and partners ran drop-in sessions, administered £500 Community Recovery payments and Property/Business resilience grants to assist affected householders and businesses, and held follow-up events to promote resilience grant programmes. (p115)
* The River Roch overtopped and high river levels prevented surface water drainage leading to widespread flooding across Littleborough and Rochdale. Infrastructure impacts included culvert damage (Calderbrook Rd, Todmorden Road, Halifax Road), gully blockages, damage to rural paths, and a landslip at Whitfield Brow that caused property evacuations. A flood warning was issued affecting the area and emergency sandbagging and temporary works were undertaken. (p118)
* Flows in the River Roch exceeded the capacity of a culvert entrance next to the new bus station causing river water to flood the town centre. Floodwater flowed along Smith Street and South Parade and re-entered the river downstream. Most businesses on Smith Street, South Parade, The Butts and The Walk were flooded; the new Council office at Number One Riverside was flooded (ground-floor library remained closed after reopening); the town centre bus station and tram terminus sustained flood damage; power loss affected many homes and businesses; substantial cellar flooding affected business operations on South Parade and Yorkshire Street; two cellars and a yard at a piling contractor's depot flooded from the River Spodden near its confluence with the River Roch; downstream the Asda superstore, adjacent Curry's PC World and Sixth Form College suffered internal flood damage and St Mary's Gate subway was damaged. (p120) [IMG, PAG]
* Central Rochdale was impacted by the floods: a rest centre was established there after the flood, sand collection points/empty sand bags were provided, and the Council Offices in Central Rochdale were flooded. (p123)
* Properties close to the River Roch flooded internally (reported internal flooding up to 400 mm). The flood extent on Boxing Day was broadly similar to Flood Zone 3. A flood warning was issued for Hey Brook at Rochdale and properties adjacent to the watercourse. River levels at the gauge were record high, indicating severe river flooding and extensive surface flows from surrounding moorland. (p126)
* Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council led investigations into surface-water flooding in its area; raised river levels and surface-water runoff caused flooding that inundated properties and allowed floodwater to enter domestic and commercial premises within the borough. (p131) [IMG, PAG]
* Quant: 288 properties (main river); 34 properties (surface water); 324 properties (total) (p17) [TAB, PAG]
* Quant: 275 properties flooded (p20) [IMG]
* Quant: 18,550 properties; 2 substations; 1.5m flood depth in substation control room; estimated £7M repair cost for control room damage; estimated £80,000 repair cost for hydroelectric plant (p21)
* Quant: 541 properties (River Roch in Rochdale) received Flood Warnings; 25 properties (Hey Brook) received Flood Warnings; 697 properties (River Roch at Littleborough) received Flood Warnings; 367 properties benefited from defences (p26) [TAB]
* Quant: 54 properties (p29)
* Quant: 1 km grid squares with 20–99 properties affected (map legend ranges); map also shows higher category up to 200–299 in the broader mapped area (p88) [IMG]
* Quant: 324 properties (p113) [IMG, PAG]
* Quant: Littleborough: 174 properties flooded (up to 1.2 m deep) (p114)

* Quant: 54 properties flooded; up to 1.5 metres flood depth measured at The Butts; two cellars; Asda flooded up to 50mm (p120) [IMG, PAG]
* Quant: 541 properties (p123)
* Quant: 25 properties (p126)
* Quant: 9 properties (p131) [IMG, PAG]

### River Irwell
* Upper Irwell and Tame catchments north of Manchester received intense rainfall that caused rapid river level rises in the Rivers Irwell, Roch and Glaze, producing widespread flooding with a very rapid onset. (p13) [PAG]
* {general}: Heavy rainfall in the upper Irwell catchment caused river levels to rise very rapidly on 26 December 2015, producing rapid river flooding across the Irwell catchment and downstream areas; many Boxing Day peak river levels were the highest on record. (p14)
* River Irwell catchment experienced exceptionally high river levels contributing to widespread flooding across the catchment area; record gauge readings correlate with flooded properties in nearby areas. (p20) [IMG]
* The River Irwell catchment was a primary focus of the heavy rainfall and recorded exceptionally high river levels on 26 December 2015, contributing to substantial river flooding, damage to river channel retaining walls, culverts and bridges, and transport of large volumes of gravel downstream. River flooding in the Irwell system was a major cause of property flooding in affected towns (including Salford). (p29)
* The River Irwell reached exceptionally high levels at multiple gauging stations and caused flooding that inundated properties (notably in Radcliffe and Redvales). Recorded high water levels coincided with property flooding in the Bury area. (p56) [PAG]
* The River Irwell rose to record/high levels at multiple gauges and caused widespread flooding across the catchment, producing residential and commercial property flooding, the collapse of the Waterside Restaurant into the river in Summerseat (with partial collapse and closure of the associated masonry arch bridge), and infrastructure failures including bridge collapses and washed-away gauges. (p57) [IMG, PAG]
* River flooding from the River Irwell caused direct inundation in Radcliffe (including Riverside Drive); river-related flooding was identified as the primary source of the event and contributed to widespread property flooding. Sewage was discharged into the river after a footbridge carrying a sewer collapsed at Lomax Street following the floods; the same collapse ruptured a gas main and caused a fire/explosion. (p61)
* The River Irwell overtopped its banks and caused flooding of Pioneer Mill (the mill was flooded from three sides); overtopping produced floodwater that reached significant depths at the mill. (p65)
* The River Irwell overtopped its banks causing flooding at Pioneer Mill and nearby areas; high flows damaged the Pioneer Mill gauging station. (p66) [PAG]
* The River Irwell overtopped a boundary wall at Chamberhall, causing inundation of industrial units after initial surface water flooding; river levels also led to ineffective outfalls from surface water drains and seepage under the wall with water emerging behind it; river flooding contributed to roads and areas being submerged beneath the Metrolink bridge and left debris. (p69) [IMG, PAG]
* Heavy rainfall over the Upper Irwell catchment contributed to flooding (saturated ground before the rain increased runoff), producing high river levels that contributed to flooding in the area (notably Haslingden). (p70)
* Exceptionally high river levels on the River Irwell caused main river flooding that contributed to the event, prevented surface water outfalls and worsened local surface water flooding; this main river flooding led to 47 properties being flooded from the river. (p72)
* The River Irwell overtopped or came to the crest of defences in the Ramsbottom reach, causing flooding of riverside recreation grounds and damage to river channel walls; contributed to road/bridge closures, emergency sandbag distribution and subsequent clean-up and recovery works. (p74)
* Record high river level at Salford (5.67 m / 29.83 AOD), 1.3 m higher than any other reading in 75 years, produced flooding conditions and led to a Flood Warning for the River Irwell (Area B). Properties experienced above-ground-floor flooding located in Flood Zone 2 and Flood Zone 3. (p84) [PAG]
* River Irwell overtopped raised defences and natural banks after high rainfall. Raised water levels (partly attributed to debris caught beneath Hough Lane footbridge) led to overtopping between Wallness Bridge and Hough Lane Bridge, causing flows into Lower Broughton, damage to river walls and walkways at the rear of the Soapworks site, erosion to a footbridge abutment in Clifton Country Park, and deposition of large amounts of debris along river banks and at Media City (requiring specialist removal). The overtopping and exceedance of the surface water network capacity resulted in widespread internal property flooding in Lower Broughton. (p139) [PAG]
* River Irwell overtopped its banks, with river water breaching containment and inundating adjacent pedestrian areas (pavement and tree bases) at Heath Lane. (p142) [IMG, PAG]
* Recorded an extreme, record-high river level (5.67 m / 29.83 AOD), 1.3 m higher than any previous reading in 75 years, representing a rare (estimated 100–150 year) event and causing river flooding in the catchment that contributed to flooding downstream. (p143) [PAG]
* Quant: 37 of 44 river level gauges recorded their highest ever levels (p20) [IMG]
* Quant: 37 of 44 gauges recorded their highest ever levels; 750 properties flooded in Salford (most heavily affected area) (p29)
* Quant: 671 properties; river levels recorded: 5.33 m at Pioneer Mills (Radcliffe), 3.39 m at Ramsbottom, 3.36 m at Blackford Bridge, 2.18 m at Bury Grounds (p56) [PAG]
* Quant: 671 properties; 900 domestic properties (affected by low gas pressure) (p61)
* Quant: Flooding affected the mill on 3 sides; 1.76 m maximum flood depth (p65)
* Quant: 6 industrial properties; depths of 0.6 to 1.0m (p69) [IMG, PAG]
* Quant: 47 properties (p72)
* Quant: around 750 properties; 164 properties; three distinct flow routes (p139) [PAG]
* Quant: 5.67 m river level; 29.83 AOD; 1.3 m higher than previous maximum; 75 years of record; estimated return period 100–150 years (p143) [PAG]

### Radcliffe
* Main-river flooding resulted in internal flooding to properties in Radcliffe/Redvales. (p17) [TAB]
* Flooding affected the Radcliffe area, inundating domestic properties; a scheme has been proposed to assess options for reducing flood risk in the area. (p20) [IMG]
* Floodwater damaged two electrical sub‑stations; electricity supply to properties was lost (widespread power outages reported in the town). (p21) [TAB]
* Flooding caused the collapse of a footbridge that carried a sewer and a gas main; the collapse ruptured the gas main and led to a gas-related incident. Gas supply was affected (low pressure) to many domestic properties and some non-domestic supplies were isolated. (p22)
* Area experienced property flooding during the event and homes were evacuated by emergency services. (p29)
* Area was affected by flooding prompting the Environment Agency and Bury Council to develop a business case and proposals for flood defences and flood storage to reduce future flood risk. (p32) [TAB]
* Radcliffe (with Redvales) was the most severely affected community in the borough: about 671 properties were flooded by the River Irwell. Maximum flood depth above ground level reached 1.4m, with typical depths of 0.6–0.8m. (p56) [IMG, PAG]
* Flood-related collapse of a footbridge at Lomax Street that carried a sewer and gas main; the collapse ruptured the gas main causing a fire and explosion and discharged sewage into the river. Temporary measures were put in place to reopen the bridge to pedestrian traffic. (p57) [PAG]
* River levels washed away the gauge at Pioneer Mill at midday on Boxing Day. Footbridges were damaged or collapsed (Lomax Street and Milltown Street), sewage was discharged into the river from ruptured infrastructure, and thousands of properties and infrastructure were affected. Power supplies were disrupted due to flood damage at electricity substations. (p58) [PAG]
* Experienced flooding that affected residents and businesses (clusters of reported flooding); a flood extent outline was mapped, prompted a community drop-in and multi-agency working group, and led to proposals and a business case being developed for a flood defence and storage scheme. (p59)
* Extensive flooding across the Radcliffe and Redvales area: 671 properties were flooded, with floodwater concentrated along Warth Road/Radcliffe Road (water flowing from under the Metrolink), York Street/Dumers Lane (water flowed over a cleared site), Morris Street, and Riverside Drive (direct river inundation). Saturated ground across the upstream 165 km2 catchment aggravated flooding. Flooding caused structural damage to footbridges in Radcliffe (one footbridge collapsed; another was damaged beyond repair). (p60) [IMG]
* Severe flooding primarily from the River Irwell inundated the town: 671 properties were flooded; a footbridge at Lomax Street carrying a sewer collapsed and discharged sewage into the river; 900 domestic properties experienced low water pressure (no loss of supply reported); a further footbridge at Milltown Street was damaged beyond repair; properties in the Higher Ainsworth Road area were flooded due to a culverted ordinary watercourse combined with surface water run-off; many businesses were affected, with some relocating outside the borough. (p61) [PAG]
* Flooding occurred across Radcliffe and Redvales with general flood depths around 0.6 to 0.8 m, properties flooded (areas lie in Flood Zone 2 and Flood Zone 3), local raised walls/embankments were present but not to formal defence standards, and flood warning coverage and thresholds were being reviewed. (p63)
* River Irwell overtopped in this area, flooding properties including Pioneer Mill (flooded from three sides), damaging infrastructure (Milltown Street footbridge damaged beyond repair), and prompting review of the River Irwell at Pioneer Mills and Parkside Close Flood Warning Area and consideration of flood defence proposals. (p66)
* Quant: 670 properties in Radcliffe and Redvales combined (p17) [TAB]
* Quant: Over 670 properties flooded (p20) [IMG]
* Quant: 3,200 properties; 2 sub-stations (p21) [TAB]
* Quant: 900 domestic properties; 2 non-domestic supplies (p22)
* Quant: 670 properties in Radcliffe and Redvales combined (p29)
* Quant: 671 properties (p56) [IMG, PAG]
* Quant: 3,200 properties (p58) [PAG]
* Quant: 671 properties; 1 footbridge collapsed; 1 footbridge damaged beyond repair (p60) [IMG]
* Quant: 671 properties; 900 domestic properties (p61) [PAG]
* Quant: general flood depth 0.6 to 0.8m (p63)
* Quant: 19 units flooded; maximum flood depth 1.76 m (p66)

### Greater Manchester
* Experienced some of the most widespread flooding on Boxing Day 2015: high river levels, internal property flooding, widespread infrastructure disruption (power loss, road closures) and environmental impacts; RMAs and councils responded across the metropolitan area. (p6)
* Area-wide impacts from the Boxing Day floods including thousands of properties and hundreds of businesses flooded, infrastructure damage, electricity substations damaged and large-scale power outages, and transport network disruption. (p7) [IMG, PAG]
* Widespread flooding across the area on 26 December 2015 that affected homes and businesses; local authorities collected addresses of flooded homes and businesses and administered a £500 Community Recovery payment; road closures occurred and Fire and Rescue Service call-out logs record emergency responses to flood incidents. (p8)
* Storm Eva (Christmas Day and Boxing Day 2015) brought the heaviest rain over Pennine areas north of Manchester; soils were saturated beforehand and close to capacity, producing high runoff and elevated flood risk across the Greater Manchester area during the 25–26 December 2015 event. (p12) [PAG]
* Sudden, extensive and deep flooding across Greater Manchester; rivers rose rapidly causing devastating impacts in parts of Bolton, Salford and Rochdale where flood depths forced some residents to be evacuated by boat. Flood levels began to recede by Boxing Day evening. (p13)
* Widespread river flooding across the Greater Manchester area on Boxing Day 26 December 2015 with many river gauges recording their highest-ever levels (Rank 1), producing extreme river levels and flows across multiple catchments (particularly the Irwell catchment). (p15)
* The Greater Manchester area experienced widespread internal property flooding during the event; the report provides an overview map of flooding across the area. (p19)
* Widespread flooding across the metropolitan area caused internal flooding of properties, issued direct flood warnings to residents, and prompted investment and mitigation planning. (p20) [IMG, PAG]
* Widespread flooding across the conurbation caused major impacts: large-scale loss of electricity supply to properties, transport disruption and flooding that exceeded design/defence levels and prompted a review of defence standards and investment needs. (p21) [PAG]
* Widespread flooding across the region caused transport disruption (tram services suspended on several routes; major rail services disrupted and route checks required; road closures, diversions and impassable roads), damage to Environment Agency assets and river defences (including destruction/damage of river gauging stations), and flooding at wastewater treatment works and pumping stations which affected treatment processes and recovery operations. Local authority offices in town centres were flooded, affecting servers and slowing recovery coordination. (p22)
* Large volumes of gravel and masonry rubble were mobilised and transported downstream during the flood and deposited in places where accumulation increased flood risk and bank erosion; Environment Agency assessed and sought removal where a clear link to increased flood risk existed. (p23)
* Widespread flooding across Greater Manchester on 26 December 2015 caused property flooding (including sewer‑related flooding), inundation of infrastructure (substations and other assets) leading to power losses, and required significant repairs to highways, cycle paths, footpaths, river channels, retaining walls and drainage systems. An extensive cleanup operation followed and utilities attended many sites to investigate and repair. (p25) [PAG]
* Widespread river flooding on 26 December 2015 prompted direct flood warnings and protective operations across the metropolitan area; properties were issued warnings and many benefited from raised defences and operational activities (debris clearance at culverts, pumping). Responders visited affected areas in the immediate aftermath. (p26)
* Experienced river flooding on 26 December 2015 that caused damage to flood defence assets, prompted nearly 4,000 asset inspections across affected areas in the following weeks, local community engagement events, and emergency repair works (including rebuilding a failed wall at Littleborough). (p27)
* Widespread flooding across the metropolitan area on 26 December 2015: 2,250 properties flooded internally (over 80PCSYM from main rivers), many more experienced external flooding, major travel disruption, damage to river infrastructure (walls, culverts, bridges), and power outages affecting over 31,200 properties. Targeted flood defences and assets protected approximately 2,450 properties. (p29)
* Widespread flooding across the metropolitan area caused devastation to many communities; flooding mechanisms were multiple (predominantly main river flooding, with surface water, ordinary watercourse and groundwater contributing). RMAs carried out inspections, repairs and community engagement across the area. (p30) [PAG]
* Widespread flooding affected communities across the metropolitan area; risk management authorities (RMAs) and responders worked together in incident response and recovery to support affected communities and have produced a joint flood investigation report with recommendations and next steps. (p31) [PAG]
* Widespread flooding across the metropolitan area on 26 December 2015 that damaged infrastructure and affected communities. Local authorities experienced damage to highways and other infrastructure and were bidding for government funding to carry out repairs; Risk Management Authorities coordinated recovery and evidence-gathering across the area. (p32) [TAB, PAG]
* Widespread flooding on 26 December 2015 affected communities across Greater Manchester (including Abram, Platt Bridge and Hindley). The event prompted an investigation and led to recommendations and planned actions to improve flood protection—specifically investigation of improvements at Hindley and consideration of natural measures to slow flows into Borsdane Brook upstream of Hindley—and coordinated work by Risk Management Authorities to prioritise and take forward measures subject to funding. (p37)
* Parts of Greater Manchester were affected by the 26 December 2015 floods; within Bury borough (part of Greater Manchester) a total of 804 properties were affected and map data show hotspots of high property impact in central Bury and southern areas near Prestwich and Manchester. (p56) [IMG]
* Internal flooding of properties within Oldham borough (part of Greater Manchester): total of 123 properties internally flooded with concentrated clusters (Delph 42, Uppermill 35, Shaw 11, Grasscroft 9 (7 surface water + 2 ordinary watercourse), Diggle 4, Greenfield 3, Lees 3, Austerlands 1, Royton 2). United Utilities received reports of 3 properties flooded from sewers. River Tame at Delph and Uppermill rose in response to rainfall. (p88) [IMG]
* Quant: 2,200 properties flooded internally; 63 communities; 7 Local Authority districts; over 2,450 properties protected by raised flood defences; over 5,700 properties received a direct flood warning (p6)

### River Roch
* The River Roch produced exceptionally high levels across the catchment on Boxing Day (26 December 2015), with multiple gauges recording their highest levels (for example Albert Royds Bridge 2.425 m, Rochdale ETW 2.222 m, Blackford Bridge 3.362 m), causing river flooding in the Roch corridor. (p15) [TAB, PAG]
* River levels in these catchments reached record highs, contributing to flooding across the catchments and exceeding defence design levels. (p20)
* Flooding of the River Roch caused structural failure and damage to formal flood defence assets: a section of flood wall adjacent to a residential care home at Littleborough completely failed and collapsed; other walls and embankments on the River Roch at Rochdale and Littleborough were damaged and programmed for repair. The collapsed gap was sandbagged as an immediate measure and wall rebuilding was included in an emergency repair programme. (p27)
* Catchments recorded exceptionally high river levels during the 26 December 2015 event, contributing to record high gauge readings and causing river-induced property and infrastructure flooding and transport of large volumes of gravel down the river network, with damage to channel retaining walls and some culverts. (p29)
* River flooding during the Boxing Day (26th December 2015) event affected Rochdale area prompting improved computer modelling of flood flows/levels from the River Roch and consideration of flood alleviation measures for the area. (p32) [TAB]
* {2012, 26 Dec 2015}: Named as a primary source of flooding that caused internal property flooding across the borough, including in Rochdale town centre and Wardleworth. (p113) [PAG]
* {2012, 26 Dec 2015}: Flooding from/associated with the River Roch prompted proposals and works to alleviate flood risk focused on the Roch and its tributaries between Littleborough and Rochdale town centre; the Roch de-culverting project has been completed as part of response measures. (p115)
* Overtopping of raised defences and natural banks from the River Roch and Greenvale Brook caused extensive flooding to nearby areas: 158 properties flooded above ground floor level; Greenvale Business Park flooded due to overtopping of the flood relief channel and overtopping of the River Roch; culvert damage at Calderbrook Rd, Todmorden Road and Halifax Road; gully blockage and damage across the area; a landslip at Whitfield Brow led to evacuation of properties. Flood depths were exacerbated by surface water and water from the Rochdale Canal. (p117)
* {2012, 26 Dec 2015}: Extremely high river levels at Littleborough prevented surface water from draining, contributed to widespread property flooding, and caused ponding against and eventual collapse of a defence wall behind Riverside Care Home. A flood warning was issued for the River Roch at Littleborough and gauge readings were the highest in 19 years, indicating an unusually large river flow that exacerbated local flooding. (p118) [PAG]
* {2012, 26 Dec 2015}: Flows in the River Roch through Roch town centre exceeded the capacity of a culvert next to the new bus station, causing river water to flood the town centre. Floodwater travelled along Smith Street and South Parade and re-entered the river downstream; businesses on Smith Street, South Parade, The Butts and The Walk were flooded; Number One Riverside council office was flooded (ground-floor library remained closed after reopening); the town centre bus station and tram terminus sustained flood damage; power loss affected many homes and businesses; the town hall narrowly avoided flooding. Downstream, the Asda superstore, adjacent Curry's PC World and the Sixth Form College suffered internal flood damage and St Mary’s Gate subway was damaged. (p121)
* {2012, 26 Dec 2015}: River Roch flooding contributed to properties and cellars flooding; historic backing-up into the river flooded cellars of 4 houses in Wardleworth in 2012. (p125) [MUL]
* {2012, 26 Dec 2015}: River flooding on 26th December 2015 caused properties close to the River Roch to flood internally (reported depths up to 400mm). Lack of defences in the vicinity of Gower Street and Weedon Street contributed to property flooding on Boxing Day. River levels measured upstream reached the highest in 22 years, indicating severe river flooding. (p126) [PAG]
* {2012, 26 Dec 2015}: River levels on the Roch rose to a very large event (highest gauge reading in 22 years at the gauge location) and caused flooding of properties (including 20 properties at Hooley Bridge Industrial Estate). (p134) [TAB]
* {2012, 26 Dec 2015}: River levels reached their highest in 22 years at Albert Royds Street (between Belfield and the town centre), producing significant river flooding that led to properties being flooded, including some properties outside Flood Zone 3. (p137)
* Quant: 37 of 44 river level gauges in the River Irwell, Roch and Croal catchments recorded their highest ever levels (p20)
* Quant: one wall completely failed; 24 formal flood defence assets recorded as having some damage (p27)
* Quant: 20,000 properties; 5,500 properties; up to 4 days (p115) [PAG]

(p58)
* The Borough experienced significant flooding from the River Irwell and related surface water run-off: 671 properties were flooded. A significant number of businesses were affected in both the immediate aftermath and longer term, with some companies relocating outside the Borough due to lack of suitable local sites. (p61)
* High river levels at Bury led to road closures to protect bridges, distribution of emergency sandbags, establishment of a rest centre at Castle Leisure Centre, multi-day clean-up operations with free skips, and flooding of the Bury wastewater treatment works which affected treatment processes and required a recovery plan. (p63)
* River Irwell levels at Bury reached an estimated peak level with an occurrence likelihood of approximately 1-in-120 to 1-in-180 years during the event; the Flood Warning Area for River Irwell at Bury is being reviewed as a result. (p66)
* {2002, 26 Dec 2015}: Multiple flood impacts across Bury on 26 December 2015: six industrial properties at Chamberhall flooded (initially by surface-water drains, then by the River Irwell overtopping a boundary wall); all flooded units experienced inundation to depths of about 0.6–1.0 m. Residential properties in Redvales and Fairfield were also affected by surface-water runoff and by flooding related to culverted watercourses and blocked drains; one flood‑proofed property flooded when water backed up through drains and leaked through walls. Ongoing investigations by Bury Council and the Environment Agency were recorded. (p68) [IMG, PAG, MUL]
* High river levels on the River Irwell at Bury occurred during the event. Local response included offering residents the opportunity to evacuate to a rest centre, safety inspections of key structures (some closures until further inspection after water levels fell), and multiple locations affected by surface water run-off and/or culvert-related flooding (notably the Lakeland Crescent area). (p70)
* Commercial properties within Bury's area (including units at Heap Bridge / J2 Business Park) were flooded when the River Roch overtopped above a hydropower weir, inundating business units and blocking access via shutters and doors.

Minor repairs on other walls/embankments in the area were also programmed. (p28)
* Internal flooding of properties in Littleborough; the Calder Brook flood basin prevented significant further property flooding in Littleborough. (p29)
* River flooding on 26 December 2015 affected Littleborough and Rochdale (including town centre and Wardleworth). Damage included collapse of a length of flood defence behind Riverside Care Home (repair scheduled/underway) and widespread impacts that led to an extended flood‑risk project: construction of a second flood storage basin on the Calder Brook near Littleborough, modelling/computer simulations for River Roch, and investigations of measures such as raising defence walls, additional flood storage, altered reservoir operation and natural flood management. (p32) [TAB]
* Littleborough and parts of Rochdale suffered river flooding; Littleborough was one of the worst-affected areas with deep internal flooding. (p114)

* Widespread flooding in the town: 158 properties flooded above ground floor level due to the River Roch and Greenvale Brook; 17 properties flooded from surface water. Raised defences and natural banks were overtopped, flood depths reached up to 1.2m in places, infrastructure damage (culverts, gullies, rural paths), Greenvale Business Park flooded, and a landslip at Whitfield Brow led to property evacuations. (p117) [PAG]
* River Roch overtopped and reached its highest recorded level at the Littleborough gauge in 19 years, causing widespread flooding. A flood warning was issued; surface water ponded against a defence wall behind Riverside Nursing Home which then collapsed into the river (the wall protected about 20 properties). Large numbers of properties flooded above ground floor in Flood Zone 3. Emergency sandbagging was carried out and a temporary sandbag wall was built where the defence failed. Infrastructure damage included culvert damage at Calderbrook Road, Todmorden Road and Halifax Road, widespread gully blockage and damage to rural paths, and a footbridge blocked by debris. A landslip at Whitfield Brow led to evacuation of properties (subject to further investigation). (p118) [IMG, PAG]
* Significant surface flows down moorland above Littleborough were recorded during the event; the River Roch flood affected the reach from Littleborough to Rochdale town centre. (p123)
* On 26th December 2015 the Upper Roch catchment (around Littleborough) and areas in Rochdale experienced significant surface water flows from saturated moorland contributing to high river levels; overall flood extent was broadly similar to Flood Zone 3 in parts of the area. (p126)

### Bury Council
* As the local authority, Bury Council established an Emergency Control Centre and a rest centre, coordinated multi-agency response, removed debris and flood-damaged items, carried out infrastructure and gully inspections and repairs, provided additional waste collections and free skips, surveyed and made parks safe, commissioned repairs and structural bridge assessments, and administered community recovery payments and grant schemes to support affected residents and businesses. (p58)
* Council enforced road closures to protect a number of significant bridges, inspected and re-opened bridges after river levels fell, distributed emergency sandbags, established a rest centre at Castle Leisure Centre, and ran a multi-day clean-up operation including provision of free skips. The Council is also working with the Environment Agency on proposals for a flood defence scheme following the flooding. (p63)
* Provided immediate response and recovery actions after the River Irwell overtopped: highways engineers removed slurry, mud and flood-damaged waste from common parts; Building Control (part of the council) required demolition of outlying dangerous sections of the mill; Economic Development officers provided business continuity advice and information on grants. (p66)
* Bury Council provided immediate response actions on the day: offered residents the opportunity to evacuate to a rest centre, carried out safety inspections of key structures (some were closed until detailed inspections after water levels subsided), and recorded that a number of locations were affected by surface water run-off and/or culvert-related flooding. (p70)

### Greenvale Brook
* Identified as one of the primary watercourses contributing to property flooding within Rochdale borough. (p113)
* Overtopping of raised defences and natural banks from the River Roch and Greenvale Brook caused extensive flooding to nearby areas: 158 properties flooded above ground floor level; Greenvale Business Park flooded due to overtopping of the flood relief channel and overtopping of the River Roch; culvert damage at Calderbrook Rd, Todmorden Road and Halifax Road; gully blockage and damage across the area; a landslip at Whitfield Brow led to evacuation of properties. Flood depths were exacerbated by surface water and water from the Rochdale Canal. (p117)
* Quant: 158 properties; depths of up to 1.2m (River Roch and Greenvale Brook) (p117)

### Electricity North West
* Responded to widespread flood-related power outages by mobilising temporary supplies and equipment; managed damaged substations and restoration work. (p21)
* Substations were inundated and defences overtopped causing loss of supply; network interconnection was used to transfer several thousand customers onto substations outside affected areas, but capacity was limited and supplies were still lost. Field teams were deployed to carry out emergency repairs once flood levels fell. (p25)
* Quant: 31,200 properties without power; 30 mobile generators mobilised; 6 sub-stations damaged; 143 properties off supply for two days; 1 property off supply for three days; 3 properties off supply for more than four days (p21)

### Calder Brook Flood Basin
* The Calder Brook flood basin (an ordinary watercourse flood alleviation asset) operated during the event and prevented significant further property flooding in Littleborough as a result of the 26 December 2015 floods. (p29)
* River flooding during the Boxing Day (26th December 2015) event led to flood risk works: a second flood storage basin on Calder Brook near Littleborough was under construction as a flood alleviation measure (completion planned Autumn 2016). (p32) [TAB]
* Quant: 175 properties (p29)

### Bolton Council
* Undertook emergency civil engineering works to resolve two blocked/collapsed culverts identified as a result of the flooding. (p42)
* Quant: 4 blocked and/or collapsed culverts; 2 culverts resolved by emergency works; 2 culverts requiring longer-term planned works; 34 distinct locations requiring detailed investigations (p42)

### Roebuck Low
* Internal flooding to properties caused by surface water flooding. (p17) [TAB]
* Quant: 1 property (p17) [TAB]

### Jepson's Clough
* Jepson's Clough caused internal flooding to a property at Scholes Bank. (p53)
* Quant: 1 property (p53)

### church
* Floodwater reaching up to lower windows and doors of the church building; temporary barriers and traffic cones deployed to restrict access, indicating access disruption and probable ground-floor property damage. (p101) [IMG, PAG]
* Interior of the church on High Street was inundated; tables and chairs partially submerged by floodwater, causing disruption to building use and requiring recovery/repairs. (p102) [IMG, PAG]

### Wright Mill
* Houses and a balcony at Wright Mill, adjacent to the River Tame, were flooded; a nearby house close to Calf Lane was reported flooded. (p111) [IMG, PAG]
* Balcony and residential properties in the Wright Mill area were flooded with surface water inundating doorways and external areas; properties experienced internal flooding. (p112) [IMG, PAG]

### Frodshams Brook
* Frodshams Brook (ordinary watercourse) contributed to flooding that led to internal flooding of properties in Standish. (p146)
* Quant: 6 properties (p146)

### Gas Services Company
* Responded to and helped bring under control a gas-main rupture that resulted from flood damage (collapse of a footbridge carrying the gas main). (p22)

### Kearsley Pumping Station
* Pumping station at Kearsley was affected by flooding, impacting wastewater pumping infrastructure and operations. (p23)

### Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service
* Deployed teams on Boxing Day to flood locations to act to minimise flooding and to support and assist people affected by the floods. (p25)

### Prestolee New Bridge
* A localised slip of the river bank occurred west of Prestolee New Bridge; the location is included in post‑flood assessments and possible future defence works (e.g. raised left bank wall) are being considered. (p45)

### Public House
* A public house suffered flooding believed to have been caused by blockage of a main river debris screen on Moor Platt Clough. (p52)

### Moor Platt Clough
* Blockage of a debris screen on Moor Platt Clough led to flooding that affected a nearby public house. (p52)

### Waterside Restaurant
* The Waterside Restaurant collapsed into the River Irwell during the Boxing Day flood, causing the partial collapse and subsequent closure of the associated masonry-arch bridge. No-one was in the building at the time; the collapse gained national TV coverage. (p58)

### Milltown Street Bridge
* Bridge was partially removed due to flood damage; temporary reinstatement of utilities carried out and repair work planned to be completed before the end of the year. (p59)

### Hutchinsons Goits
* {general}: A culverted watercourse (Hutchinsons Goits) has historical issues and is prone to blockage; blockage results in carriageway flooding beneath the Metrolink line and along Warth Fold Road, with floodwater then flowing across Radcliffe Road onto farmland and affecting a small number of properties. (p69)

### Canoe Pass Weir
* Structural damage to the weir at Canoe Pass was caused by the flood; a visible breach and collapse of concrete/stone was recorded and the local authority sought quotes for repairs. (p73) [IMG]

### Bottoms Hall Cottages
* Further flooding affected Bottoms Hall Cottages on Boxing Day. Floodwater from an ordinary watercourse / culverted flow and overland flows inundated low-lying properties at this location. (p77)

### Smallbrook
* Surface water overwhelmed drainage at the street/road level: water pooling and flowing over a drain cover, indicating culvert/gully surcharge and localised urban surface flooding that impeded drainage. (p106)

### Salix Homes
* Salix Homes had properties within the flooded area and actively assisted their tenants during the flooding event. (p145)

### Abram Pumping Station
* Pumping station was reported to have almost flooded as Hey Brook came out of its channel downstream of the pumping stations. (p150)
