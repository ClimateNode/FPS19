### Bedford
* {December 2020, 23 Dec 2020 - 26 Dec 2020}: Various locations across the borough experienced flooding during the December 2020 flood event. (p1)
* Widespread and exceptional flooding across the borough from both surface water runoff (overland flows) and the River Great Ouse; villages to the north of Bedford experienced rapid overland/surface water flooding as catchments became overwhelmed and watercourses were at capacity. (p3)
* Widespread flooding affected residential, commercial, community and educational properties across the borough, including internal property flooding reported at multiple locations and resulting in 27 formal investigations of internal flooding. (p4)
* Clusters of flooding incidents occurred in and around the town, producing access impacts to roads, footpaths and open spaces. Specific local impacts cited include footpath access issues in Kingsbrook Ward (vicinity of Oasis Pool, Cardington Road, Goodmayes Close) and impacts in Castle Ward and Newnham Ward due to flood waters and drainage/culvert discharge. (p6)
* Floodwaters rendered bridges impassable in affected locations. (p7) [TAB]
* Widespread flooding across the Borough left debris and siltation in properties, roads, footways, local drainage systems and watercourses requiring cleansing and maintenance. Five affected properties’ residents used council rest centres (one household later moved into a hotel, others stayed with family/friends). Multiple roads and bridges were reported impassable (listed locations include High Street Pavenham; Hinwick Road, Hinwick; High Street, Lower Dean; Knotting Road, Melchbourne; High Street, Great Barford; footpath access near Cardington Road; bridges at Oakley and Radwell), which hindered Highway and Resilience Teams and Police access. (p10) [IMG]
* Multiple locations within the borough adjacent to the River Great Ouse experienced river (fluvial) flooding during the 23–26 December 2020 event; Flood Warnings were issued for low-lying areas in the borough (including Boating Lake and Priory Lake in Bedford on 25/12/2020). (p14) [TAB]
* Above-average rainfall in the week before 23 Dec 2020 caused Main River and ordinary watercourse levels to rise and led to instances of surface water and river flooding across the borough. Several communities experienced flooding with insufficient or late Flood Warnings (including no Flood Warning issued for Harrold and Wyboston), causing anxiety and disruption to residents and complicating emergency response. (p15)
* Main-river and linked lake/ditch assets in the Bedford area were stressed during the event; post‑event actions include inspections of main river assets, checks around boating/prior y lakes and investigation of Kings Ditch trigger levels and communication to IDB duty officer to manage ditch capacity. (p21) [TAB]
* The 23 December 2020 flood involved ditch/river capacity issues (Kings Ditch mentioned) and surface water/overland flows affecting properties and highways across the borough, prompting investigations and remedial works by agencies. (p24) [TAB]
* The Bedford area experienced flooding of highways and properties on 23rd December 2020, prompting multi-agency activity including clearing culverts and highway drains, inspection of Main River assets, investigations into flood-warning improvements, and consideration of upstream storage/NFM to reduce future flood impacts. (p26) [TAB]
* Kempston High Street experienced flooding during the event. Culverts on High Street became blocked and required clearance (two culverts were cleared in March 2021). Temporary drainage works were carried out after the flood: grips were dug either side of High Street to divert water into adjacent ditches, and a resident cleared/maintained the ditches following the flood. (p27) [TAB]
* Properties and local infrastructure were affected by flooding leading to follow‑up actions: inspection of Main River assets (sluices, weirs, gates, locks and river banks), highway drainage inspections and clearing of blockages, investigation of property flood protection options, and support/formation of community flood groups to improve preparedness and access to flood kits, action plans and warnings. (p28) [TAB]
* Localised flooding affected the town: gullies on High Street, Church Lane and Spring Lane were silted/blocked and were cleared in March 2021; highway drainage in the vicinity of an affected property was investigated and cleared (completed May 2021); culvert condition upstream of an affected property was investigated and assessed for capacity; community flood-debriefs and investigations into community flood group, flood action plans and property flood resilience measures were recommended. Flood warnings were noted as not issued for at least one location and improvements to the Flood Warning system were recommended. (p30) [TAB]
* On 23 December 2020 flooding affected parts of Bedford via backing-up and high flows in Riseley Brook and via constrained/blocked drainage (ponds, ditches and culverts). Properties were affected, prompting inspections and remedial actions (investigate drainage continuity, culvert clearing, maintenance of ditches/ponds, consideration of new headwall, and community flood group support and planning). (p32) [TAB]
* Flooding on 23 December 2020 prompted investigations and remedial actions across the area, including clearing highway drainage and culverts (works completed for sections of High Street and Green Lane in May 2021), inspections of watercourse assets, and consideration of community flood groups, PFR information and Natural Flood Management upstream measures. (p33) [TAB]
* Surface water/urban flooding occurred in Bedford on 23rd December 2020, prompting investigation of culverts and maintenance of ditches and consideration of property-level flood resilience measures (including for a flooded utility room). (p34) [TAB]

* A Flood Warning was not issued for Harrold during the event; this lack of warning contributed to concern and anxiety among residents and left insufficient time for preparation/evacuation in the face of flooding. (p15)
* Harrold experienced flooding that affected highway drainage and local watercourses. Response actions include clearance of blocked highway drains (e.g. around Orchard Lane), setting up a community flood group with flood kit and plan, investigations and maintenance of nearby watercourses and culverts, and proposals for capacity improvements and a flood warning system. (p21) [TAB]
* Local flooding from watercourses and constrained culverts affected the village (including Vicarage Lane area); actions recorded include culvert condition investigation, assessment of downstream river influence, maintenance of watercourses, consideration of a flood warning system, and community resilience measures (flood kits, flood plans, PFR information). (p22) [TAB]
* Quant: 1 residential; 4 residential (p7) [TAB]

### Upper Dean
* Overflow from an unnamed ordinary watercourse (tributary to River Til) caused internal flooding of properties and made local lanes impassable (Brook Lane and Shay Lane). (p7) [TAB]
* River Till-related flooding prompted a Flood Warning for Upper Dean on 23/12/2020 (Flood Warning issued 23/12/2020 16:57), indicating river flooding affected Upper Dean. (p14) [TAB]
* Upper Dean was affected by river/floodwater during the event, triggering post‑event actions including capacity checks at watercourse crossings, liaison with riparian owners on maintenance, investigation of flood warning improvements and appraisal of Natural Flood Management (flood storage) options upstream. (p21) [TAB]
* The Upper Dean watercourse required liaison with landowners for inspection/maintenance and capacity checks at watercourse crossings to identify improvements, indicating the watercourse caused flooding impacts to the locality and infrastructure. (p29) [TAB]
* Upper Dean and its upstream catchment were identified as locations for potential flood storage to hold back floodwater after the event; this indicates the village and surrounding catchment were impacted by flooding and are the focus of mitigation investigations. (p30) [TAB]
* Quant: 2 residential (p7) [TAB]
* Quant: over 5,000 checks; 22 assets (p29) [TAB]

### River Great Ouse
* The river contributed to fluvial flooding across the borough between 23 and 26 December 2020, causing internal flooding and transport disruption in multiple locations (roads/bridges impassable). Specific locations flooded by the Great Ouse in the report include Bedford boating/prioriy lakes, Clapham, Kempston Marina Court, Odell, Turvey and Wyboston. (p7) [TAB]
* Intense rainfall across the catchment on 23–24 December 2020 increased runoff into drainage systems and watercourses, causing river levels to rise and overtop banks and contributing to surface water and fluvial flooding in and around Bedford (including reported basement ingress at some properties). (p11)
* The River Great Ouse generated multiple Flood Alerts and Flood Warnings across the borough (alerts issued 22/12/2020 and warnings 24–25/12/2020), and is named as the source of fluvial flooding affecting towns such as Turvey, Odell, Clapham, Kempston and Bedford. (p14) [TAB]
* Surges and peaks along the Great River Ouse changed considerably during the event; the variable timing of these river surges produced inconsistent information that contributed to inaccurate expectations, community anxiety and difficulties in managing the flood response. (p15)
* Flooding of the River Great Ouse affected properties along the river, leading to consideration of remedial works and new flood alleviation or defence measures to reduce future risk and increase property resilience. (p18)
* Quant: 1 commercial and 1 educational (Bedford - Boating Lake); 1 commercial (Bedford - Priory Lake); 4 residential and 1 commercial (Clapham); 9 residential (Kempston - Marina Court); 3 residential (Odell - Great Ouse); 2 residential and 1 commercial (Turvey); 1 commercial (Wyboston); 4 residential (Harrold - South) (p7) [TAB]
