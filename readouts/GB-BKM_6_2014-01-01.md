## Place names with coordinates

### Chalfont St Peter
* The village experienced flooding during January–March 2014 following prolonged rainfall and exceptionally high groundwater. A culvert flow restriction caused the River Misbourne to back up, contributing to backup of the surface water drainage network. Blockage and groundwater infiltration within the sewer network caused foul water overflows onto the A413 and within the village centre. (p4)
* After a prolonged period of above-average rainfall and exceptionally high groundwater levels, river levels were raised and a culvert flow restriction in the village caused the River Misbourne to back up, which may have caused a backup of the surface water drainage network. A blockage in the sewer network caused an overflow of foul water onto the A413 and groundwater infiltration into the sewer network caused foul water overflows within the village centre. Internal flooding affected business premises within the village. (p5) [PAG]
* The village contained two identified flood problem locations: a sewer overflow discharging onto Gravel Hill (location A) and road and property flooding at a junction near location B (around TQ 00102 90885). The River Misbourne flows through the village (partly culverted in the centre) and is implicated in local fluvial/drainage-related flooding that contributed to these issues. (p8) [IMG, PAG]
* Sewer overflow discharged onto Gravel Hill (location A) and road and property flooding occurred in the area around TQ 00102 90885 (location B). Flooding was associated with the River Misbourne and a small tributary, and the village centre contains a culverted section of the Misbourne (culvert under St Peter's Court split into two pipes) that is implicated in local drainage/flooding behaviour. (p9) [IMG, PAG]
* Road and property flooding in the village centre (area B). A sewer overflow discharged onto Gravel Hill (area A). Culverting of the River Misbourne in the centre and culvert connections beneath the High Street/St Peter's Court were implicated in the flooding. (p10) [IMG, PAG]
* {general}: Fluvial flood map indicates areas of the village adjacent to the River Misbourne would be inundated in 1 in 100 and 1 in 1000 year events; surface water flood map shows additional extents for 1 in 30, 1 in 100 and 1 in 1000 year events. Built-up and open areas, including residential properties and key infrastructure near the river and culverted sections, are shown at greatest risk. Several properties are noted as built above the culverted river which affects vulnerability. (p14) [IMG, PAG]
* During the January–March 2014 event groundwater incursion affected Chalfont St Peter by entering the foul sewer network, contributing to sewer-related flooding problems in the village. (p15) [IMG, PAG]
* Groundwater incursion entered the foul sewer network, causing sewer flooding in the village during the reported event. (p16) [IMG, PAG]
* {November 2000–February 2001, February 2001, 12 Feb 2001 - 13 Feb 2001, November 2006, December 2006, January 2007, February 2007, March 2007, May 2007, October 2010, November 2010, January–March 2014}: Groundwater incursion into the foul sewer network during the event described in the report (January–March 2014). Historic fluvial and surface-water flooding of the village centre (November 2000–February 2001) with sewage often combining with floodwater, causing road closures (including one week in February 2001) and business disruption (the Greyhound Inn repeatedly flooded and closed from February 2001). The village centre was flooded to a depth of 45 cm in February 2001. (p17) [PAG, MUL]
* {2005, November 2006, December 2006, January 2007, February 2007, March 2007, May 2007, October 2010, 16 Mar 2013, 16 Mar 2013 - 20 Mar 2013, 16 Mar 2013 - 26 Mar 2013, 25 Mar 2013, 05 Aug 2013}: Multiple flood incidents were recorded across the village: drain flooding incidents recorded in 2006–2007 on various roads; a reported flood in Lower Road in 2005; road flooding reported in October 2010 (including West Hyde Lane, Denham Lane and Amersham Road at the Greyhound roundabout); sewage-laden water and overflowing manholes on High Street on 16 March 2013 causing a health hazard to pedestrians; underpass under the A413 flooded (reported 16–20 March 2013 and again 25 March 2013); multiple road flooding instances 16–26 March 2013; High Street flooded again on 05 August 2013; culvert silt blockage and gullies failing to drain were reported. (p18) [PAG, MUL]
* {05 Jan 2014 - 06 Jan 2014, 07 Feb 2014, 10 Feb 2014}: Manholes overflowed with sewage-laden water causing sewage to enter the George pub on the High Street; gullies on the High Street were unable to discharge fully due to high River Misbourne levels and culvert restriction, causing surface water accumulation; internal flooding occurred at the Greyhound Inn and a road closure occurred associated with the flooding. (p24) [MUL]
* The culvert under St Peter's Court was partially restricted, causing water to back up; that obstruction apparently prevented surface water from draining into the River Misbourne via highway drainage connections and caused surface-water backup at ground level. (p29)
* Chalfont St Peter experienced flooding from the River Misbourne and surface water (including flooding of the High Street and areas adjacent to the river). (p38) [TAB, PAG]
* Local residents experienced flood incidents and were advised to sign up for Environment Agency flood warnings, protect property, document and report flooding, and consider forming a Flood Action Group to improve local response. (p40) [TAB, PAG]
* Quant: internal flooding of two or more business premises within an area of 1km2; High Street closed for approximately two weeks (p5) [PAG]
* {05 Jan 2014 - 06 Jan 2014, 07 Feb 2014, 10 Feb 2014}: Quant: two instances caused sewage entry to the George pub; road closure for at least 10 hours (p24) [MUL]

### St Peters Court
* Culverted River Misbourne and highway drainage under the High Street / St Peter's Court were implicated in flooding: connections into the east culvert beneath the High Street were mapped, and the area around TQ 00102 90885 experienced road and property flooding. A nearby sewer overflow onto Gravel Hill was also identified as a related issue. (p10)
* The culvert beneath St Peter's Court was partly restricted, contributing to road and property flooding in the nearby area (area B around TQ 00102 90885). High River Misbourne levels and the culvert restriction prevented gullies on the High Street from discharging at full capacity; once the culvert was cleared and gullies jetted, surface water cleared rapidly. (p23)
* River Misbourne experienced high water levels driven by above‑average rainfall and exceptionally high groundwater. The river was the recipient of sewage‑laden discharges that were permitted temporarily (subject to dissolved oxygen monitoring). High river levels contributed to backing up of surface water where drainage was obstructed. (p29) [PAG]
* Internal flooding of business premises; business activities were indirectly affected by local flooding that reduced parking availability and pavement usage by customers. (p30) [PAG]
* High water levels in the River Misbourne, driven by prolonged above-average rainfall and exceptionally high groundwater, contributed to preventing drainage and to local flooding and sewer overflows. (p37)
* Chalfont St Peter was directly impacted by flooding associated with the River Misbourne and surface water on the High Street; residents and landowners adjacent to the Misbourne were identified as affected and targeted for advice and interventions. (p38) [TAB]
* Quant: at least 2 business premises (p30) [PAG]

### High Street, Chalfont St Peter
* The High Street was closed due to flood impacts (including foul water overflows and drainage backups), causing significant local disruption and affecting access and businesses in the village centre. (p5)
* Culverted River Misbourne and highway drainage under the High Street / St Peter's Court were implicated in flooding: connections into the east culvert beneath the High Street were mapped, and the area around TQ 00102 90885 experienced road and property flooding. A nearby sewer overflow onto Gravel Hill was also identified as a related issue. (p10)
* {November 2000–February 2001, October 2010, November 2010}: A flow restriction in the culvert through which the River Misbourne passes under the High Street (identified by a CCTV survey in November 2010) contributed to flooding issues in the village centre; High Street/Lower Road are noted as recurring problem areas for road flooding and sewage discharges; the village centre flooded to a depth of 45 cm in February 2001. (p17) [PAG, MUL]
* {16 Mar 2013, 05 Aug 2013}: 16 March 2013: High Street flooded with sewage-laden water; manholes were overflowing and road gullies were not draining, creating sewage contamination and a health/inconvenience hazard to pedestrians. Underpass flooding and multiple road-flooding instances affecting the area were reported from 16–26 March 2013. 05 August 2013: High Street flooded again (this event reported without sewage); multi-agency follow-up and culvert clearance actions were pursued. (p18) [MUL]
* {05 Jan 2014 - 06 Jan 2014, 07 Feb 2014}: Gullies on the High Street were unable to discharge to the River Misbourne at full capacity leading to surface water accumulation; manholes overflowed with sewage-laden water entering the George pub on the High Street during incidents reported in January and February 2014. (p24) [MUL]
* {05 Jan 2014 - 06 Jan 2014, 07 Feb 2014, 12 Feb 2014}: Sewage-laden water from overflowing manholes entered premises on the High Street: The George pub suffered internal flooding on multiple occasions (reported weekend 05/06 January 2014; again 12 February 2014) and the Greyhound Inn suffered internal flooding (07 February 2014). Road and pavement around the nearby A413 zebra crossing were contaminated and required clean-up; pumping to relieve High Street flooding was considered but not used due to risk to downstream properties. (p25) [PAG, MUL]
* The culvert downstream of High Street was surveyed and cleared as part of the response; TfB cleared road gullies in the flooded area after culvert clearing. The EA reported no obstructions, culverts of ample capacity and the channel conveying water efficiently along this stretch. (p27) [TAB]
* {November 2000–February 2001, October 2010, November 2010}: Quant: 45 cm flood depth (p17) [PAG, MUL]
* {05 Jan 2014 - 06 Jan 2014, 07 Feb 2014}: Quant: 1 pub (George) flooded (p24) [MUL]

### Buckinghamshire

(p25) [MUL]
* {January–March 2014, 18 Feb 2014, 21 Feb 2014}: Organised and led multi-agency response to high river levels in Chalfont St Peter (meeting on 18 February 2014). Coordinated jetting operations downstream of a culvert; contractor unable to deploy silt nets because of high water. Jetting removed large amounts of silt, pieces of plywood, branches and general refuse and continued until 21 February 2014; remaining silt was expected to be flushed out naturally as river levels fell slowly during the week of the works. (p26) [MUL]
* Quant: two or more business premises; High Street closed for approximately two weeks (p6) [IMG, PAG]

### Chalfont St Giles
* {11 Feb 2014}: The Affinity Water pumping station in the village ceased pumping because it was flooded. (p25)

## Topics without coordinates

### Thames Water
* {16 Mar 2013}: A Thames Water contractor accompanied an Environment Agency site visit on 16 March 2013 to investigate manholes overflowing with sewage; no blockage was found and manholes ceased overflowing by the end of the day. Buckinghamshire County Council noted it had not been provided with records of flooding from Thames Water. (p18)
* {05 Jan 2014 - 06 Jan 2014, 07 Feb 2014, 10 Feb 2014}: Responded to reports of manholes overflowing with sewage-laden water; found a blockage within the sewer network next to the A413 and was notified of sewage overflows that entered premises (including the George pub) and caused internal flooding at the Greyhound Inn and a road closure. (p24) [PAG, MUL]
* {05 Jan 2014 - 06 Jan 2014, 07 Feb 2014, 10 Feb 2014, 11 Feb 2014, 12 Feb 2014, 13 Feb 2014, 14 Feb 2014 - 21 Feb 2014}: Responded to multiple sewage overflow incidents and associated surface water/culvert-related flooding in Chalfont St Peter (reported weekend 05/06 January 2014 and 07 February 2014 and further incidents in February 2014). Sewage-laden water entered The George pub on the High Street (multiple times); the Greyhound Inn suffered internal flooding (07 February). Agencies attended site visits and discussed pumping but pumping was not used to avoid increasing downstream residential flooding; Environment Agency undertook emergency culvert clearance (16–21 February) because of significant disruption. Buckinghamshire County Council (BCC) was unable to obtain information from Thames Water about Thames Water's response to the flooding reports on the specified dates. (p25) [MUL]
* {January–March 2014, 18 Feb 2014, 20 Feb 2014}: Thames Water discharged sewage-laden water into the River Misbourne under EA agreement during the high-water period and was required to monitor dissolved oxygen daily. TW were asked to consider reinstating pumping from sewers into the Misbourne, obtain additional pumping capacity, check and clear a downstream blockage near Gravel Hill, send clean-up/gulley-suction teams (requested for 18/02/2014), and to investigate holding tanks and sewer lining as longer-term measures. TW undertook an information-gathering exercise reported on 14/05 to prioritise 20 catchments affected by infiltration and groundwater problems. (p28) [TAB, PAG, MUL]
* At least two business premises flooded internally during the event; business activities were also indirectly affected by village-centre flooding that disrupted parking and pavement access for customers. (p29) [PAG]
* A culvert under St Peter's Court was partially restricted; this obstruction caused water to back up and prevented surface water draining, contributing to ground-level flooding. (p30) [PAG]
* {17 Feb 2014}: EA built a sandbag wall of approximately 500 sandbags to protect properties on Hilion Crescent and the adjacent industrial area while a blocked culvert was jetted; the wall was constructed to prevent flood water entry to properties during emergency works. (p33) [TAB, PAG]
* Riparian landowners along the River Misbourne were required to clear vegetation and debris, maintain culverts and avoid dumping garden waste because blocked banks and debris had contributed to flooding risk during the event. (p40) [TAB]
* {05 Jan 2014 - 06 Jan 2014, 07 Feb 2014, 10 Feb 2014}: Quant: 1 pub (George) flooded; 1 inn (Greyhound Inn) internally flooded; road closure for at least 10 hours (p24) [PAG, MUL]
* Quant: 2 business premises (p29) [PAG]

### Environment Agency
* {16 Mar 2013, April 2013, May 2013, 19 Aug 2013, September 2013}: Conducted site visits and investigations into overflowing manholes and road flooding: site visit on 16 March 2013 investigating manholes overflowing with sewage (found high chamber water levels but free-flowing; manholes no longer overflowing later), attempted CCTV of a silt-blocked culvert in April 2013, contacted the riparian owner requesting culvert clearance in May and September 2013, and participated in a multi-agency site visit on 19 August 2013 to follow up on the blocked culvert. (p18) [PAG, MUL]
* {05 Aug 2013, 19 Aug 2013, September 2013, October 2013, 25 Nov 2013}: Followed up with the riparian owner after the August 2013 flood: contacted the owner in September and October 2013 regarding culvert clearance, and issued a formal notice on 25 November 2013 requiring the clearance work to be completed (notice allowed 90 days). (p19) [MUL]
* {20 Feb 2014}: Inspected the river downstream of High Street to the Kingsway/A413 roundabout (reported 20 February 2014) as part of the response; found no obstructions to flow, culverts with ample capacity, and that the channel was conveying water, informing further response actions. (p26)
* {20 Feb 2014}: EA surveyed the river (approx. 1000m downstream of the culvert) and found no obstructions, culverts of ample capacity, no need for channel realignment, channel conveying water efficiently and bank height adequate; EA enforcement checked upstream development (Misbourne Farm) and concluded recent works did not increase downstream flood risk. (p27) [TAB, PAG]
* {20 Feb 2014}: Environment Agency enforcement officer carried out site visits (including 20/02/2014), reviewed Thames Water discharges to the River Misbourne, allowed controlled discharges subject to daily dissolved-oxygen monitoring, and maintained contact with site owners; EA actions were part of the immediate flood response and water-quality oversight. (p28) [TAB, PAG]
* {17 Feb 2014}: Properties on Hiljon Crescent and an adjacent industrial area were at risk from flooding and were protected by an EA-built sandbag wall during culvert jetting operations. (p33) [TAB, PAG]
* Flooding of the River Misbourne affected Chalfont St Peter and adjacent landowners/residents; the Misbourne was identified as the watercourse causing local flooding and a focus for remedial works and potential EA-led management schemes. (p38) [TAB, PAG]

### Chalfont St Peter Parish Council
* Chalfont St Peter was identified as a known problem area during the Jan–Mar 2014 floods: temporary flood defence options were to be reviewed, the area prioritised for rapid incident response, and sewer capacity/infiltration problems investigated. (p40) [TAB]

### Transport for Buckinghamshire
* {general}: Transport for Buckinghamshire (TfB) owns and maintains the highway surface water drainage in Chalfont St Peter; the mapped drainage network (including pipes and culverts beneath the High Street and St Peter's Court) was directly related to the locations where sewer overflow and road/property flooding occurred. (p10)

### Colne Catchment Basin
* The Colne catchment received exceptionally high rainfall in late 2013 and February 2014, leading to elevated river levels that contributed to the January–March 2014 flooding in the catchment (including a very wet February described as the third wettest since records began). (p20)

### Culvert
* {20 Feb 2014, 21 Feb 2014, 22 Feb 2014}: Blocked/affected culvert was associated with road flooding in the village; culvert clearing was carried out (clearing finished 21/02/2014) and associated road gullies were jetted (22/02/2014) to restore flow. (p27) [TAB, MUL]

### Chiltern District Council
* CDC was directly involved in post‑event response and planning: recommendations included coordinating street cleaning and gully emptying, considering sewer capacity in planning decisions, promoting waste management to reduce drainage blockages, and consulting Thames Water on larger planning applications to mitigate sewer/flood risk. (p40)

### A413
* {February 2014}: The A413 carriageway was covered by floodwater across its full width and under a bridge, likely impeding or preventing traffic movement. (p47) [IMG, PAG]
