## Place names with coordinates

### Bournemouth
* Heavy surface-water flooding inundated urban streets and a public park, with water covering road surfaces and reaching up to the top of a park fence. Traffic was disrupted with buses and other vehicles driving through deep water; street furniture and shopfront frontages were partially submerged and debris was floating in the floodwater. (p1)
* Widespread flooding across the borough causing significant property damage, disruption to local transport and prolonged displacement of residents. A major clean-up operation was undertaken by the council and partners. (p3)
* A significant, highly localised storm centred on the Town Centre produced intense rainfall (epicentre moved N/NE over Winton and Charminster) that caused surface water/urban flooding across Bournemouth; the borough was affected more severely than neighbouring Poole and Weymouth. (p5)
* Widespread heavy rainfall and surface-water flooding across Bournemouth produced gridlock on major routes: Wallisdown Road (A3049) was totally grid locked with cars stuck in flood waters between Boundary Road and the University; Castle Lane (A3060) East and West were closed, impassable or grid locked, including access to/from Bournemouth Hospital via the Cooper Dean Roundabout. (p12) [PAG]
* Rapid-onset surface water/urban flooding across the town: major roads (e.g. Castle Lane A3060 east and west, Wessex Way A338, Pier Approach Flyover) were closed, impassable or gridlocked (access to/from Bournemouth Hospital via Cooper Dean Roundabout affected). The sewerage system was overwhelmed causing manholes to surcharge foul sewage, manhole covers to be blown off, and road surfaces to lift; highway gullies blocked with debris. A small retaining wall collapsed in Exeter Road. Flooding to properties occurred within about 15 minutes of the heavy rainfall and subsided quickly. (p13) [PAG]
* Experienced very localised but intense rainfall that caused significant local flooding problems (surface water/urban flooding); prompted major cleanup efforts and highlighted the town’s vulnerability due to urban nature and topography. (p17)
* Multiple urban areas within Bournemouth were flooded during the storm; the council identified five significant localised areas for further study and assessed its own properties to identify high-risk properties for potential protection measures. (p18)
* The coastal fringe shows clusters of external flood points, indicating the coastline and immediate coastal urban area experienced flooding on 18th August 2011. (p26) [IMG]
* Widespread flooding on 18th August 2011 concentrated in low-lying coastal and estuarine areas and along river valleys. Flooded locations clustered near the coast and river mouths, with events scattered across multiple administrative areas. (p27) [IMG]
* Widespread surface-water flooding on 18 August 2011 affected multiple areas (including Lower Gardens and Boscombe Chine); rapid runoff from the Bourne stream produced fast, dangerous flows and combined-sewer surcharge led to sewage-contaminated floodwater. Grassed areas contaminated by sewage were fenced off on public-health advice (advised to remain out of bounds), and extensive clean-up was required to allow reopening for the second day of the air festival. (p30) [TAB, PAG]
* An intense rain storm produced rapid surface runoff and flash flooding across the town; sewers surcharged causing sewage contamination of grassed areas (fenced off and advised out of bounds), multiple road closures and localised property flooding/runoff, risk from the rapidly rising Bourne stream, and large-scale immediate cleanup to enable reopening of event areas. (p31)
* On 18 August 2011 Bournemouth experienced localised surface-water/urban flooding: PA reported records of approximately 250 properties internally flooded (believed to be an underestimate); Castle Lane West was closed restricting access to the hospital (alternative routes existed); public areas such as the Lower Gardens were taped off because shallow but fast-flowing water posed safety risks; the event generated ~50–60 calls to the Environment Agency from the Bournemouth/Poole area. (p37) [TAB]
* Quant: 270 reported or observed incidents of flooding; 157 properties flooded internally (p3)
* Quant: over 80 incidents; about 800 additional calls (believed); 52 Fire Brigade calls from the Bournemouth area in one hour; 20 DFRS appliances and five from Hampshire deployed; 33 calls to Wessex Water (p12)
* Quant: five significant localised areas (p18)
* Quant: nearly 1000 calls; 4 days (p31)
* Quant: 250 properties; 50-60 calls (p37) [TAB]

### Bournemouth Hospital
* Access to and from the hospital via the Cooper Dean Roundabout was affected (closed, impassable or grid locked) because of flooded roads. (p12)
* Access for emergency vehicles was impeded for a short period when roads (including the Copper Dean Roundabout) were closed because of vehicles stranded in flood water; the council noted that resources would have been switched to protect the hospital if flooding had continued. (p30) [TAB, PAG]
* Roads (including the Copper Dean Roundabout) were closed due to flood water, affecting access for emergency vehicles to the hospital for a short period. (p31)
* Access to the hospital was restricted because flooding in Castle Lane East impeded traffic and access routes. (p33) [TAB]
* Flooding on 18 August 2011 led to the closure of Castle Lane West, restricting access to the hospital (alternative routes were available). The closure was a direct consequence of the flood event. (p37) [TAB]
* Castle Lane West was closed by flooding on 18 August 2011, which restricted access to the local hospital (alternative routes were available). (p38)
* Access to the hospital was restricted because Castle Lane West was closed by flooding; alternative routes existed and the hospital itself was not flooded. (p39)
* Quant: no properties (p37) [TAB]
* Quant: 0 properties (p38)
* Quant: 0 properties affected (p39)

### Castle Lane West, Bournemouth
* Both east and west sections of Castle Lane were closed, impassable or grid locked as a result of flooding. (p12)

* Castle Lane West was closed during the 18 August 2011 surface water/urban flooding, restricting access to the Hospital. (p37) [TAB]
* Castle Lane West was closed by flooding on 18 August 2011, which restricted access to the local hospital (alternative routes were available). (p38)
* Road was closed due to flooding, which restricted access to the nearby hospital. (p39)
* Quant: no properties (p37) [TAB]
* Quant: 0 properties (p38)

### Town Centre
* The storm was initially focused on the Town Centre, producing heavy localized surface water flooding that contributed to borough-wide disruption. (p3)
* The storm was centred on the Town Centre and produced the most intense, localised rainfall, triggering surface water/urban flooding in the immediate area. (p5)
* Heaviest rain affected the town centre causing surface-water/urban flooding: many town-centre roads (including parts of the Wessex Way (A338) and the Pier Approach Flyover) were closed or impassable to cars and grid locked by floodwater. (p12)
* The flood event overwhelmed the sewerage system causing manholes to surcharge foul sewage, some manhole covers to be blown off and road surfaces to lift. Highway gullies were blocked with debris. There was localized property damage and considerable short-term disruption to the transport system, with numerous road closures and some infrastructure (a small retaining wall in Exeter Road) collapsing. (p14)
* Quant: some 270 reported or observed incidents of flooding; at least 157 properties were flooded internally (p14)

### Hampshire
* Deployed five appliances to assist with the emergency response to flooding in the Bournemouth area. (p12)

### Winton
* Parts of Charminster and Winton experienced the heavy rainfall and localised flooding as the storm moved north/north-east. (p3)

* Quant: two areas (p18)

### Charminster
* Parts of Charminster and Winton experienced the heavy rainfall and localised flooding as the storm moved north/north-east. (p3)

### Poole
* Surface water flooding occurred in parts of Poole and Weymouth as reported by the Environment Agency; these areas were affected by flooding on the same day but were not impacted as severely as Bournemouth. (p5)

### Weymouth
* Surface water flooding occurred in parts of Poole and Weymouth as reported by the Environment Agency; these areas were affected by flooding on the same day but were not impacted as severely as Bournemouth. (p5)

### Queens Park
* Parts of Queens Park flooded during the storm, and the area was identified as one of the five significant localised areas selected for further study because of the number of properties affected (emphasis on residential properties). (p18)

### Muscliff
* A part of Muscliffe, including Castle Lane West, experienced flooding during the storm and was identified as one of the five significant localised areas for further study based on the number of properties affected (residential emphasis). (p18)

### West Howe

### Boscombe
* Lower Gardens and Boscombe Sea front was identified as a flood ‘hot spot’ during the 18 August 2011 event; operatives concentrated clean-up and response activity there following heavy surface water/urban flooding of public and highway areas. (p33) [TAB]

### Exeter Road, Bournemouth
* A small retaining wall collapsed during the rapid flooding event, raising fears that buried services had been damaged (which later proved unfounded). (p13)
* Closed due to flood water during the event, restricting access and causing traffic diversions (reported with Pier Approach Flyover closures); identified as a location requiring future investigation/scheme work by Wessex Water. (p33) [TAB]
* Road was closed due to flood water during the event, contributing to traffic disruption and diversion (traffic being turned around at Priory Hill). (p34) [PAG]

### Meon Road, Bournemouth

* Reported as closed or impassable during the 18 August 2011 event as a consequence of flooding, affecting traffic and access. (p15)
* Experienced problems during the event that affected traffic movements (police were redirecting traffic via Wessex Way), indicating flood-related disruption. (p33) [TAB]

### Wallisdown Road, Poole
* Road was totally grid locked with cars stuck in flood waters on the stretch by Boundary Road and the University. (p12)
* Reported as closed or impassable during the 18 August 2011 event; closures were part of the immediate response to flooding and associated highway impassability. (p15)

### Castle Lane East, Bournemouth
* Both east and west sections of Castle Lane were closed, impassable or grid locked as a result of flooding. (p12)
* Flooding on 18 August 2011 restricted access along Castle Lane East and impeded access to the Hospital, cited during prioritisation discussions of response resources. (p33) [TAB]

### Castle Lane, Bournemouth
* Much of Castle Lane (A3060), both east and west sections, was closed, impassable or grid locked due to flooding; this included disruption of access routes. (p12)

### Boundary Road, Bournemouth
* Stretch between Boundary Road and the University had cars stuck in flood waters, causing complete gridlock. (p12)

### Wimborne Road, Bournemouth
* Sections of the road were reported closed or impassable during the 18 August 2011 event. Residents reported that the wash from passing vehicles exacerbated property flooding adjacent to the road and some residents physically blocked the road to try to prevent further wash-induced flooding. (p15)

### Nutley Way, Bournemouth
* {September 2008, 18 Aug 2011}: Reported to have flooded badly during the 18 August 2011 event (and had also flooded in September 2008); identified as a high-risk hotspot requiring attention. (p33) [TAB, MUL]

### Lower Gardens
* The gardens and adjacent seafront were flooded and required a major clean-up because sewage contamination was a concern; areas that could not be disinfected were roped off, manhole covers were replaced/repaired, debris was collected and disposed of. The clean-up enabled the area to be in use for the second day of the Air Festival. (p14)
* Lower Gardens and Boscombe Sea front was identified as a flood ‘hot spot’ during the 18 August 2011 event; operatives concentrated clean-up and response activity there following heavy surface water/urban flooding of public and highway areas. (p33) [TAB]

### Boscombe Chine
* Boscombe Chine (an emergency access for the Air Show) was affected by the intense surface-water flooding from the storm on 18th August 2011. It was a focus of clean-up operations so the Air Show could open on the second day; teams worked late into the previous evening and early the next day. Minor damage to covers and tarmac was reported as possible and costs were expected to be absorbed within existing budgets. (p30) [TAB, PAG]
* Identified as an affected area and was an emergency access for the Air Show; subject to clean-up operations so the air festival could open on the second day. (p31)

### Cooper Dean Roundabout
* Access to and from Bournemouth Hospital via the Cooper Dean Roundabout was rendered impassable/closed due to flood water during the intense rainfall, contributing to local road closures and gridlock. (p12)

### Pier Approach Flyover

## Topics without coordinates

### Bournemouth Borough Council
* Widespread flooding across the borough causing significant localised property damage, considerable disruption to the local transport system, and long-term displacement of some residents (some could not return to their properties for at least six months). The Council recorded incidents and led/participated in the clean-up and response. (p3)
* Bournemouth Borough Council employees were directly involved in immediate flood response following the intense storm of 18 August 2011 — staff ‘manned the pumps’ and helped coordinate and carry out cleanup of the Air Festival, the beaches and large areas of the town. (p4)
* Operated local Gold Command and handled large numbers of flood-related calls; logged over 80 flooding incidents while receiving around 800 additional calls, stretching their ability to record details during the flood event. (p12)
* The sewerage system was totally overwhelmed causing manholes to surcharge foul sewage, manhole covers to be blown off and road surfaces to lift. Highway gullies became blocked by debris washed off adjacent areas. A small retaining wall collapsed in Exeter Road (raising concerns about services). Significant property flooding and local transport disruption occurred; emergency road closures were implemented. Immediate post‑flood clean-up of the Gardens and seafront was led by the Council alongside Wessex Water and the Environment Agency, addressing sewage contamination (areas roped off), replacing/repairing manhole covers and removing debris. (p14)
* Council was directly involved in the immediate response and cleanup after the surface water/urban flooding; experienced minor communication difficulties during response and identified need for longer-term investigations and collaboration with other agencies. (p17)
* The 18 August 2011 extreme event (approaching a 1-in-100-year event) produced significant surface-water/urban flooding that overwhelmed the piped drainage/sewer system. This prompted the Council to work with Wessex Water to install sewer monitors (to observe system response), update sewer models for Bournemouth, combine those models with surface water modelling, and to develop highly localised solutions including a temporary flood storage solution in Kinson using parkland to store water from surface water sewers and release it slowly back to the sewer. (p19)
* Coordinated response to flooding on 18 August 2011: provided advice to residents affected by flooding; worked jointly with Wessex Water on a mitigation project at the Kinson flood ‘hot spot’ (using parkland to temporarily store surface water sewer outflows and return it slowly to the sewer); initiated work on five areas described as severely affected; and recommended improvements to communications and information collection for future flood events. (p20)
* Council-owned housing was damaged by the floods; discussion concerned insurance and repair approaches (building insured by the council, tenants responsible for contents; minor repairs were sometimes carried out rather than claiming insurance excesses). (p30)
* Council services led and coordinated clean-up of flood-affected public areas; council-absorbed cleanup costs within existing budgets; council-owned grassed areas were contaminated by sewage and fenced off on Environmental Health advice (out of bounds for 4 days); council housing suffered flood damage (building insured by council) and local drainage/run-off from council land contributed to flooding in some areas. (p31) [PAG]
* The Ask Bournemouth contact centre was temporarily overwhelmed by flood-related calls; staff advised people reporting sewage flooding to contact Wessex Water directly, raising concerns about the adequacy of advice given. (p32) [PAG]
* Council (BBC) operatives were on the ground during the 18 August 2011 event, worked with Wessex Water on clean-up concentrating on hot‑spots (e.g. Lower Gardens and Boscombe seafront), managed traffic diversions where roads/bridges (Pier Approach Flyover, Exeter Road, Priory Hill) were closed by floodwater, and experienced some coordination confusion during response. (p33) [TAB]
* Internal flooding of properties in Bournemouth during the 18 August 2011 event; public areas (e.g. parts of the Lower Gardens) were taped off and access restricted; Castle Lane West was closed restricting access to the hospital (alternative routes existed). Local authority emergency arrangements were activated (Gold Command meetings) and council services were engaged in response and clean-up. (p37) [TAB]
* Quant: 270 reported or observed incidents of flooding; at least 157 properties flooded internally (p3)
* Quant: over 80 incidents; some 800 additional calls (p12)

* Quant: nearly 1000 calls; 4 days (p31) [PAG]
* Quant: nearly 1000 calls (p32) [PAG]
* Quant: 250 properties (p37) [TAB]

### Wessex Water
* Participated alongside the council and other partners in the major clean-up operation carried out into the night and early morning following the floods. (p3)
* During the 18th August 2011 event Wessex Water handled large numbers of public enquiries about drains and flooding. Their call centre used detailed questionnaires but, because of call volumes and limited information from callers, staff were frequently unable to record accurate locations of flooding; this hindered subsequent investigation and inclusion of affected properties on formal registers (DG5). (p15)
* Sewer network was identified as a key failure mechanism during the extreme 18 Aug 2011 surface-water event; Wessex Water has been commissioned to update sewer models and install monitors to observe sewer response to intense rainfall so as to verify model predictions and support mitigation. (p19) [PAG]
* Wessex Water provided an excellent emergency response and assisted the council with clean-up operations; they supported efforts addressing sewer surcharge and contaminated runoff and were identified as a partner to engage to reduce flood ‘hot spots’ and infrastructure vulnerabilities. (p30) [TAB, PAG]
* Combined/foul sewers surcharged in the lower gardens producing heavily contaminated runoff; Wessex Water staff assisted with the cleanup and were engaged in the immediate response to sewage/flooding incidents. (p31)
* Wessex Water received a large number of calls from about 09:45 on 18 August 2011 reporting internal and highway flooding, mobilised operations staff and contractors to assist with clean-up, worked on identified hot‑spots (including Lower Gardens and Boscombe seafront), liaised on the ground with the Council, and incurred additional contractor costs to support response efforts. (p33) [TAB]
* Wessex Water mobilised all operations staff (bringing people in from as far as Taunton) and contractors to assist with on‑the‑ground clean up at flood hot‑spots (e.g. Lower Gardens, Boscombe seafront). WW incurred extra contractor costs, coordinated with the Borough Council operatives, and experienced operational limitations because the event exceeded their design standard for sewer drainage; they clarified their liabilities for sewer‑sourced internal flooding and provided billing rebates for customers (see quant). (p34) [PAG]
* Responded to flooding caused by the extreme rainfall on 18 August 2011. Funding and works targeted at resolving internal sewer flooding (AMP allocation for the WW region), completed a small pumping station in Queens Park, and carried out works in Priestly Road (approx £1 million). Policy: internal flooding from the sewerage system entitles affected properties to a 100PCSYM rebate of sewerage charges (50PCSYM rebate if external flooding); flood-resolution funding prioritises internal flooding and requires incidents to be recorded on the DG5 register to trigger works. (p35) [PAG]

### Environment Agency
* Responded to the 18 August 2011 surface-water flooding event: duty engineer was on duty; Environment Agency teams were sent into the Poole and Bournemouth areas to assess and assist; the Agency provided a team of 9 people to help the clean-up; its national call centre received around 50–60 calls from the Bournemouth/Poole area; agency capability (pumping equipment and up to 150 people) was available to deploy. (p37) [TAB]
* Reported internal flooding of properties in Bournemouth (local assessment of flooded properties); provided operational response — deployed two assessment teams to the Poole and Bournemouth areas, supplied a team of 9 people to assist with clean-up, and could supply pumping equipment and up to 150 people if required; handled public calls via its national call centre during the event. (p38)
* Quant: 9 people; 50-60 calls; 150 people (p37) [TAB]
* Quant: 250 properties; 2 teams; 9 people; 150 people (p38)

### Dorset Fire and Rescue Service
* Responded to emergency flood incidents in Bournemouth — first call at 10:46 and over the next hour received 52 emergency calls; deployed multiple appliances to address flooding incidents. (p12)
* Quant: 52 calls; 20 DFRS appliances (p12)
