## Place names with coordinates

### Oakdale
* Internal flooding of residential properties (homes flooded internally). (p19) [TAB]
* There were reports of flooding on 4–5 Jun 2022 impacting Oakdale/Sterte: internal, external and highway flooding. Some reports related to the watercourse adjacent to Oakdale Junior School; debris screens were observed opened and water pooled behind a screen. (p28)
* Flooding on 04–05 Jun 2022 led to multiple internal, external and highway flood reports in the Oakdale locality; the watercourse adjacent to Oakdale Junior School contributed to local inundation and debris screens were compromised/opened during the event. (p29) [IMG]
* Affected by surface water/urban flooding during the intense rainfall on 04 Jun 2022 - 05 Jun 2022; debris and leaf litter contributed to blocked gullies/channels, prompting consideration/installing of debris screens and channel clearance works. (p31)
* Quant: 2 residential properties (p19) [TAB]
* Quant: 10 reports of flooding (p28)
* Quant: 10 reports of flooding (p29) [IMG]

### Poole
* Areas of the conurbation within Poole (examples given include Hamworthy and Upper Parkstone) experienced the intense rainfall event and associated surface water flooding; the Livingstone Road Junior School rain gauge in Upper Parkstone recorded ~31 mm in one hour during the event. (p5)
* Residential and commercial properties flooded internally during the event; internal flooding recorded in homes and businesses. (p19) [TAB]
* Parts of Poole Town Centre around Kingland Road/Crescent flooded during the event; two buildings in the area flooded internally and a subway near The George Roundabout flooded to a shallow depth. (p26) [PAG]
* Low-lying area around the Dolphin Shopping Centre and Kingland Road where surface-water/urban flooding occurred or was modelled as likely; two nearby buildings were reported to have flooded internally during the event and local low subways flooded to a shallow depth. (p27)
* Intense, localised rainfall on 4–5 June 2022 caused surface water / urban flooding that mainly affected properties in Poole. Local drainage was overwhelmed in some areas, with blocked gullies and debris contributing to poor drainage performance and localized inundation. (p31)
* Quant: 2 residential properties; 2 commercial properties (p19) [TAB]
* Quant: 2 buildings; 1 subway (p26) [PAG]
* Quant: two buildings (p27)

### Penn Hill
* Residential properties flooded internally during the event. (p19) [TAB]
* The Penn Hill area directs surface water runoff down local roads toward a low point (bottom of Archway Road) where drainage was overwhelmed, causing flooding on multiple occasions including 4 June 2022. Accumulation of pine needles in gullies and urban creep increasing impermeable surfaces were identified as contributing factors. (p24)
* Penn Hill was affected by surface water flooding during the 04 Jun 2022 - 05 Jun 2022 rainfall; locations within the area (notably around Archway Road) were identified for further SWMP study. (p33) [TAB]
* Quant: 5 residential properties (p19) [TAB]

### Lower Gardens
* Floodwater covered much of the park area, submerging benches and pathways as shown in imagery and described in the report; one kiosk likely flooded. (p30) [IMG]
* Quant: one kiosk (p30) [IMG]

### Hamworthy
* Experienced intense, short-duration surface water/urban flooding during the 4–5 June 2022 heavy rainfall event. The area was within the western sector where the heaviest rainfall and most flood reports were recorded; the event caused localized surface water inundation and contributed to internal flooding incidents in the western conurbation. (p5)
* Hamworthy experienced an intense convective rainfall event on the night of 4 June 2022 (heavy downpour starting around 23:15). Rainfall observations record approximately 22.6 mm between 23:00 and 00:00 on 4 June 2022, producing conditions associated with local surface-water/flash flooding and significant drainage stress in the Hamworthy area. (p18) [IMG]
* Surface water accumulated south of the railway and ponded at a low point on Blandford Road causing highway flooding. Water flowed into gullies and a nearby channel that discharges to Holes Bay; restricted channel capacity downstream (within the Holes Bay SSSI) limited discharge. Post-event works (desilting and reprofiling of outfall channels in late Oct 2022) were carried out to improve channel and outfall capacity. BCP Highways improved the local gully system and plan increased gully inspection frequency; Wessex Water plan to improve a pipe junction in a manhole near the Blandford Road low point to improve drainage. (p22) [IMG]
* Experienced flooding impacts during the intense rainfall on 04 Jun 2022 - 05 Jun 2022; channel clearance was organised/undertaken in response to blocked channels and drainage issues. (p31)
* Area experienced surface water flooding during the rainfall event of June 2022 and contains locations (e.g. Blandford Road) identified for further study and potential flood alleviation works. (p33) [TAB]

### Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole
* Intense convective rainfall on the night of 4–5 June 2022 produced extensive surface water / urban flooding across the BCP conurbation, causing internal flooding of residential and commercial properties. Some reports indicated foul sewage was present in floodwater. Six of the previously flooded properties were recorded as flooding internally again during a heavy rainfall event on 5 September 2022. (p5)
* Recorded cluster of flooding incidents on 4–5 June 2022 concentrated over Poole, including internal property flooding, internal + sewage incidents, external + sewage incidents and highway (road) flooding; social media and reports captured gardens, highways and roads flooding across the area. (p20)
* Quant: 21 residential properties; 4 commercial properties; 6 properties (subsequently flooded again on 5 September 2022) (p5)

### Dorset
* Local and media reports described a thunderstorm on 4–5 June 2022 that ‘brought flash flooding’ across Dorset; specific local reports (e.g. Upton) described torrential rain and flooding impacts associated with the event. (p20)
* Intense thunderstorm on the night of 4–5 June 2022 produced flash and surface-water flooding across the county: social media and news reports describe gardens and highways flooding (reports specifically naming Ringwood Road, Whitecliff, Lilliput and Canford Cliffs), flooded roads in Parkstone, and widespread intense rainfall, thunder and lightning. The storm is also associated with severe road-surface damage reported in Poole. (p21) [IMG, PAG]

### Sterte
* Part of the Oakdale/Sterte area where flooding reports were received; system outlets are at/below sea level requiring pumping and the local drainage/pumping system and debris screens were implicated during the event. (p28)
* Quant: 10 reports of flooding (p28)

### Parkstone
* Internal flooding of a commercial property (business premises flooded internally). (p19) [TAB]
* Flooded roads reported during the 4–5 June 2022 storm (social media/comments on local articles noted flooded roads in Parkstone). (p20)
* Quant: 1 commercial property (p19) [TAB]

### Bournemouth
* Parts of Bournemouth experienced intense, short-duration rainfall (examples in the text include Southbourne and small numbers of reports in Northbourne), resulting in surface water flooding and internal flooding of residential and commercial properties in parts of the town. (p5)
* Localized, intense rainfall on the evening of 4 June 2022 produced surface-water/urban flooding in Bournemouth; the event is the subject of this flood investigation and was highlighted by Met Office radar showing the heaviest rainfall concentrated around Bournemouth and adjacent areas. (p10) [IMG]

### Canford Cliffs
* Social media reports cited Lilliput and Canford Cliffs among the areas where gardens and highways flooded during the storm on 4–5 June 2022. (p20)
* Topography of the Penn Hill / Canford Cliffs area channels surface water runoff down roads (including Archway Road) toward a low point where drainage was overwhelmed and caused flooding on multiple occasions, including 4 June 2022. (p24)

### Northbourne
* A small number of flood reports were recorded in Northbourne during the 4–5 June 2022 intense rainfall event, indicating localized surface water flooding impacts in the area. (p5)

### Whitecliff
* Social media reports identified areas of Whitecliff as experiencing flooding during the 4–5 June 2022 storm, with mentions of gardens and highways flooding. (p20)

### Lilliput
* Social media reports cited Lilliput and Canford Cliffs among the areas where gardens and highways flooded during the storm on 4–5 June 2022. (p20)

### Branksome Chine
* Branksome Chine is the downstream receiver of the open watercourse that conveyed excess surface water runoff from the Penn Hill/Archway Road area during the event (including 4 June 2022). (p24)

### Blandford Road, Poole
* Surface water accumulated at the low point on Blandford Road causing localised flooding of the highway; runoff south of the railway entered highway gullies and drained into a channel near Hewitt Road that discharges to Holes Bay. Following the flooding event, outfall channels were desilted and reprofiled to improve drainage, and highways gully improvements were carried out. (p22) [PAG]
* {20 Jul 2021, 04 Jun 2022 - 05 Jun 2022, of October 2022}: Blandford Road is at a low point where surface water accumulates south of the railway, flows into highway gullies and drains into a channel near Hewitt Road toward Holes Bay. The location has experienced flooding (investigated for the 20 July 2021 rainfall event) and is shown to be at risk on local surface water flood maps; this topographic and tidal situation limits the effectiveness of partial works and suggests property-level resilience measures should be considered. (p23)
* Identified as being affected by surface water flooding during the June 2022 rainfall event and nominated as a location needing a Surface Water Management Plan / consideration for flood alleviation options. (p33) [TAB]

### Archway Road, Penn Hill
* Surface water runoff was channelled to a low point at the bottom of Archway Road where drainage was overwhelmed beyond design capacity, resulting in flooding during the event on 4 June 2022. Blocked highway gullies (exacerbated by pine needles and debris) and the connection to a Wessex Water surface water sewer contributed to the issue. Post‑event works included an additional gully connection completed in October 2022 and clearance of the downstream culvert debris screen to improve drainage. (p24)
* The area around Archway Road experienced surface water flooding during the heavy rainfall of 04 Jun 2022 - 05 Jun 2022 and was identified as requiring a Surface Water Management Plan (SWMP) study. (p33) [TAB]

### Kingland Crescent, Poole
* Kingland Crescent experienced flooding during the event; the Poole Food Bank storage facility located on this street had its ground floor flooded and lost stock. (p26) [PAG]
* Flood modelling confirms that surface-water flooding is likely in Kingland Crescent; the Poole Food Bank storage facility is located here and was affected by flooding during the event. (p27)

### Ringwood Road, Bournemouth
* Reports on social media described Ringwood Road as flooded during the intense rainfall on the night of 4–5 June 2022, indicating highway/surface-water flooding affecting the road. (p20)

### Hewitt Road, Poole
* {general}: The drainage channel near Hewitt Road was heavily silted and contributed to restricted discharge capacity; it was desilted and reprofiled by BCP in late October 2022 after flooding, which visibly improved channel capacity and outfall discharge. Flows, however, remain somewhat restricted further downstream within the Holes Bay SSSI and the channel will require regular hand maintenance and periodic mechanical works. (p23) [IMG]

### North Lodge Road, Penn Hill
* Described as being on the route of surface water flow paths that channel runoff toward the low point at the bottom of Archway Road; this routing contributed to the drainage being overwhelmed and the subsequent flooding experienced on 4 June 2022. (p24)

### Penn Hill Avenue, Penn Hill
* Parts of Penn Hill Avenue are identified as being on the flow paths directing runoff toward the low point at Archway Road; this contributed to drainage being overwhelmed and flooding during the 4 June 2022 event. (p24)

### Canford Cliffs Road, Poole
* Parts of these roads are on surface water flow paths that direct runoff toward the low point at the bottom of Archway Road; runoff from these streets contributed to the drainage being overwhelmed and to flooding recorded on 4 June 2022. (p24)

### Kings Avenue, Penn Hill
* Parts of these roads are on surface water flow paths that direct runoff toward the low point at the bottom of Archway Road; runoff from these streets contributed to the drainage being overwhelmed and to flooding recorded on 4 June 2022. (p24)

### Kingland Road, Poole
* Area described as low-lying with the bus station low relative to Kingland Road; surface-water flood modelling (1 in 30-year 1 hour and 1.0PCSYM AEP) indicates flooding is likely at Kingland Road and adjacent bus station during the event. (p27)

### Poole Bus Station
* Floodwater covered the bus station platform and surrounding pavement, with water reflecting station structures; the station appeared non-operational due to inundation. (p26) [IMG]
* Within the Poole Town Centre / Kingland Road area: two buildings were reported to have flooded internally in total; the bus station and a subway flooded (subway to a shallow depth); Poole Food Bank storage flooded and lost stock. (p27) [IMG]

### Newtown and Heatherlands
* Experienced internal flooding of residential properties during the event. (p19) [TAB]
* Quant: 2 residential properties (p19) [TAB]

### Alderney and Bourne Valley
* Experienced internal flooding of commercial property during the event. (p19) [TAB]
* Quant: 1 commercial property (p19) [TAB]

### Redhill and Northbourne
* Internal flooding of a residential property (home flooded internally). (p19) [TAB]
* Quant: 1 residential property (p19) [TAB]

### Branksome Park Wood
* An open watercourse that receives flow from the Wessex Water surface water sewer runs down Branksome Park Wood; this channel conveyed excess runoff during the event (including 4 June 2022). A debris screen at the culvert leading into this watercourse was cleared at the end of October 2022 to improve drainage after the flooding. (p24) [PAG]
* {04 Jun 2022 - 05 Jun 2022, of October 2022}: The debris screen at the end of the culvert that leads into the watercourse in Branksome Park Wood was blocking drainage (contributing to reduced drainage capacity) and was cleared at the end of October 2022, which improved the drainage capability. (p25) [MUL]

### Oakdale Junior School
* The watercourse adjacent to Oakdale Junior School was associated with some of the flood reports for 4–5 June 2022; it drains into the Sterte Surface Water Pumping Station and contributed to local flooding observations. (p27) [IMG]
* The watercourse adjacent to the school was implicated in flooding reports; debris screens along that watercourse were found opened after the event, indicating local watercourse flooding impacted the school vicinity. (p28)

### Holes Bay
* Downstream channel capacity within the SSSI in Holes Bay restricted the outfall’s ability to discharge surface water after the flood event, contributing to reduced drainage efficiency from upstream (including Blandford Road). (p22) [IMG]

### George Roundabout
* A subway near The George Roundabout reportedly flooded to a shallow depth during the event. (p27)


## Topics without coordinates

### Poole Food Bank Storage
* The storage facility on Kingland Crescent had its ground floor substantially flooded, causing stock losses; the store closed for assessment and cleanup and reopened on 14 Jun 2022. (p26)
* Storage facility was located in a modelled surface-water flood risk zone and experienced flood damage that caused stock losses. (p27) [PAG]

### Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole Council
* Multiple flooding incidents were recorded across the BCP area during 4–5 June 2022, with a concentration of internal (property) flooding and internal+sewage incidents around Poole. The council area experienced external and highway flooding reports as well; reports were collected via multiple customer systems and logged onto FORT after the event. (p20) [PAG]
* BCP (Highways) undertook post‑event works: desilting and reprofiling the outfall channel in late October 2022 to improve drainage, committed to regular hand maintenance of the channel, and carried out gully system improvements and reviews of gully inspection frequency in response to the flooding. (p22)
* BCP carried out post‑flood response and mitigation actions following the event: gully clearance and investigative works, installation of an additional gully connection at the low point (completed early October 2022) and clearance of the culvert debris screen at the outfall (end of October 2022) to improve surface water drainage after flooding occurred on 4 June 2022. (p24)
* BCP carried out surface-water flood modelling that identified likely flooding (including 1.0PCSYM AEP risk) around the Dolphin Shopping Centre/Kingland Road/Kingland Crescent and staff observed debris screens had been opened following the flooding event. (p27) [PAG]
* BCP Council teams responded to the 4–5 June 2022 event by undertaking site visits and interviews, investigating flood impacts, carrying out highway drainage surveys, gully clearance and installation works, and FCERM Asset Management explored debris screens and organised channel clearance in Hamworthy and Oakdale. (p31)

### Wessex Water
* {general}: Wessex Water is planning to improve a junction between two pipes in a manhole near the low point on Blandford Road to improve flow and allow the surface water sewer system to drain more easily; this is a response to capacity/flow issues that have contributed to local flooding. (p23) [PAG]
* A Wessex Water surface water sewer was connected to multiple BCP highway gullies at the low point; excess surface water runoff overwhelmed drainage capacity (including the connected sewer system) on 4 June 2022, contributing to flooding. Subsequent works included clearing a debris screen at the culvert outfall to improve drainage. (p24)
* Wessex Water carried out drainage surveys and was involved in incidents that included foul sewerage flooding following the intense rainfall on 4–5 June 2022; it also liaised with BCP Highways regarding potential highway drainage improvements. (p31)
