## Avon In Bristol
* High astronomical spring tides combined with a storm surge caused increased tidal levels and flooding associated with the River Avon, increasing flood extents and producing tidal inundation that significantly affected the riverside road network. (p3)
* Areas adjacent to the tidal reach of the River Avon within the Bristol City Council boundary were flooded on the high tides of 11th and 12th March 2020. The report lists eight specific locations affected along the river (Sea Mills Lane → Crew’s Hole Road footpath), showing a linear pattern of flooding following the river course. (p6) [MUL]
* Tidal surge propagated up the River Avon increased city-centre high tide levels at Bedminster Bridge, producing higher than predicted water levels in Bristol city centre (contributing to flood hazard in the city centre). (p9) [PAG, MUL]
* Tidal surge was forced up the River Avon as the tide rose, increasing water levels between Avonmouth and inner-city locations (via the narrowing channel), producing higher-than-predicted city-centre tide levels and increasing flood risk in the central area. (p10) [PAG, MUL]
* Tidal surge propagated up the River Avon raising water levels between Avonmouth and Bedminster Bridge, contributing to underestimation of city-centre tide levels when an Avonmouth adjustment of 0.15 m was used. Areas adjacent to the River Avon with topographic levels below recorded high tides suffered tidal flooding (flood extents mapped at Sea Mills, the Portway and Cattle Market Road). (p11) [PAG, MUL]
* Tidal flooding from the River Avon overtopped into the Floating Harbour (via Bathurst Basin and Junction Lock), inundating low-lying areas adjacent to the river and allowing tidal water to enter harbour areas. (p12) [PAG, MUL]
* Elevated tidal levels on 11th March 2020 caused high river levels along the River Avon, contributing to flooding at multiple locations listed in Table 5 (e.g. measured 8.63 mAOD at Avonmouth and 8.81 mAOD at Bedminster Bridge). (p13) [PAG]
* High tides on the River Avon caused flooding of roads and at least one residential property in locations along the river (Portway, Cumberland Basin area, Sea Mills Lane, Cattle Market Road, Commercial Road, Clarence Road), leading to road closures and shallow flooding at some roads. (p15) [TAB]
* High tidal levels associated with the River Avon during the 11–12 March 2020 high tides produced the highest recorded tide (exceeding the 1981 level) and caused internal flooding of a residential property on Sea Mills Lane. Flood defences (Shirehampton flood gates and the Cumberland Road flood wall) were operated/held and protected several properties from flooding along Avon Crescent, Cumberland Road and Commercial Road. (p16) [TAB, PAG, MUL]
* A storm surge combined with relatively high tides and strong SW/W winds caused tidal flooding from the River Avon, inundating residential areas adjacent to the river (including properties on Avon Crescent) and requiring some evacuations. (p17) [PAG]
* High tides caused rises in water levels affecting the river/harbour margins; the River Avon footpath at Crew’s Hole Road and areas in St Phillips were closed/managed due to the tidal event. (p18)
* Environment Agency closed flood gates along the River Avon (for example at Shirehampton), undertook pre- and post-tide checks, and cleared key structures and screens to prevent tidal ingress and manage the tidal flooding threat. (p19)
* Tidal flooding of the River Avon caused flooding at local areas including Sea Mills (flooding of the road, parked cars and a property; many properties deployed flood barriers/gates). Tidal flood water also significantly affected the Portway and Cattlemarket Road, forcing their closure. (p20)
* High tidal surge on 11th March 2020 produced elevated water levels that threatened the city centre and low-lying riverside locations. Tide predictions (converted to city-centre levels) and monitoring led to road closures (notably the Portway) and other protective actions; high tide was observed at vulnerable River Avon locations (Bathurst Basin, Cattle Market Road, Cumberland Basin, The Portway, Sea Mills). Harbour operations were altered (floating harbour lowered) and sluices were to be opened to manage high tides. (p24) [PAG]
* High tide / storm surge on the River Avon produced tidal flooding risk to the city centre and adjacent assets; prompted tide-level monitoring, warnings, and coordinated road closures and protective actions by council teams. (p25) [PAG]

* Internal flooding of a residential property when tide levels exceeded the property’s demountable flood barrier and water entered through the side gate into the lower-lying rear of the property. (p16) [MUL]
* High tidal flooding on 11th March 2020 caused inundation and disruption to the highway network and car parks, prompting active management and closures of roads and car parks (including Portway, Sea Mills Lane, Cattle Market Road, Brunel Lock Carpark, Cumberland Basin Road, River Avon footpath at Crew’s Hole Road and St Phillips). Maintenance contractors were deployed to pump tide water off the highway; the Portway was kept closed overnight when the tide exceeded the forecast. (p18)
* Tidal flooding inundated Sea Mills Lane, flooding the road, parked cars and one property; many properties in the area deployed flood barriers/gates in response. (p20)
* Area (including highway/residential infrastructure) was affected by the high tide/storm surge; local property flood defences in Sea Mills largely held. (p22)

* Quant: Defence: 8.30 m AOD; Estimated high tide: 8.78 m AOD (p14) [TAB, PAG]

## Sea Mills
* Tidal flooding extents were observed during the high-tide/ storm surge event; visual evidence (videos and photographs) of tidal flood extents at vulnerable areas was gathered, prompting recommendations to investigate flood risk and potential mitigation measures and to improve modelling for Sea Mills. (p4)
* The Sea Mills area adjacent to the River Avon is shown as a flood location and was affected by tidal flooding during the high tides on 11th and 12th March 2020. (p6) [MUL]
* Significant tidal flooding inundated Sea Mills Lane on 11 March 2020, covering the road and adjacent areas and partially submerging multiple parked vehicles, causing localised residential and access disruption. (p12) [IMG]
* A flood warden was appointed for Sea Mills and the Environment Agency arranged delivery of property flood resilience measures to address tidal flood risk associated with the event. (p19)
* The Sea Mills area was affected by tidal flooding during high tide events: flooding occurred on Sea Mills Lane (road, parked cars and one property) and many properties deployed flood barriers/gates. The area is identified as particularly vulnerable to tidal flooding and at increased future risk from sea level rise. (p20)
* Flood defences largely prevented inundation in Sea Mills but one property was flooded; Sea Mills Lane (highway) was listed among affected locations. (p22)
* Residents were contacted and warned to install flood barriers and prepare for high tide flooding; Sea Mills was photographed as a vulnerable location during the high tide. (p25) [PAG]
* Quant: 1 property (p20)

## Cumberland Basin Road
* Tidal inundation during the 11th March 2020 high tide. Cumberland Basin Road appears in Table 5 as a flooded location with an estimated high tide level used to calculate maximum flood depths in Table 6. (p13) [TAB]
* Cumberland Basin Road was estimated to have been inundated by the high tide with an approximate maximum flood depth of 0.40 m. Roads around the Cumberland Basin were closed for approximately 4.5–5 hours on the evening of 11 March and again on the morning of 12 March, implying about 4.5 hours of flooding at this location. (p14) [TAB, PAG]
* The road was inundated during high tides and was closed during the high-tide events on the evening of 11 March and the morning of 12 March, causing traffic closures and preventing access while flooded. (p15) [TAB, MUL]
* High tidal flooding on 11th March 2020 caused inundation and disruption to the highway network and car parks, prompting active management and closures of roads and car parks (including Portway, Sea Mills Lane, Cattle Market Road, Brunel Lock Carpark, Cumberland Basin Road, River Avon footpath at Crew’s Hole Road and St Phillips). Maintenance contractors were deployed to pump tide water off the highway; the Portway was kept closed overnight when the tide exceeded the forecast. (p18)
* Identified for closure on 11th March 2020 because predicted high tides posed a risk of tidal inundation to the road; highway teams were advised which roads to close and monitor. (p24)
* On 11th March 2020 high tidal levels affected Bristol, producing tidal inundation risk to the city centre and multiple transport routes; specific impacts included recommended/implemented road closures (The Portway, Cumberland Basin Road, Cattle Market Road and others) and warnings to residents and riverside businesses to protect properties from tidal flooding. (p25) [PAG]
* Quant: 8.77 mAOD (estimated high tide level) (p13) [TAB]

## Bristol
* High astronomical spring tides combined with a storm surge on 11-12 March 2020 caused tidal flooding across the Bristol region; roads along the River Avon were significantly impacted and one property flooded internally; no essential infrastructure reported flooded. (p3)
* The city experienced tidal River Avon flooding on 11th and 12th March 2020 at multiple points along the river, affecting central and adjacent districts and key transport routes and infrastructure (e.g., Cumberland Basin, Bathurst Dam as noted in mapped sites). (p6) [IMG, MUL]
* The central area of Bristol was the focus of the report for a tidal flooding event during high tides; actions taken included issuing flood alerts/warnings, opening sluice gates on the River Frome to outlet downstream of Black Rocks, closing flood gates on the River Avon, and deployment of EA officers and community information teams. Surge predictions underestimated the tide height, leading to a higher-than-predicted tide during the event. (p19)
* On 11 March 2020 (and into 12 March 2020) Bristol experienced tidal/coastal flooding caused by an astronomical high tide combined with a storm surge and westerly winds; the event reached a peak of 8.81mAOD and affected several areas across the city, including the Portway and Cattle Market Road. (p21) [PAG]
* City-wide tidal flooding (astronomical high tide combined with storm surge reaching a peak of 8.81mAOD) caused inundation of multiple areas and affected residential and highway infrastructure across Bristol (including Portway beneath Clifton Suspension Bridge, Commercial Road, Bathurst Basin, Cumberland Road, Clarence Road, Cattle Market Road, Crew’s Hole Road footpath and Sea Mills Lane). (p22)
* Quant: 1 property (p3)
* Quant: 8 locations (p6) [IMG, MUL]

## Avonmouth
* {03 Nov 2020, 03 Dec 2020}: Measured high tide levels at the Avonmouth monitor on 11–12 March 2020 exceeded the EA forecasts, showing a larger-than-predicted surge component which contributed to higher tidal levels affecting the area. (p8) [TAB, PAG, MUL]
* Used as the upstream tidal reference point for forecasts; an added adjustment of 0.15m to Avonmouth tide values underestimated actual increases to the city centre, contributing to higher-than-predicted city-centre tide levels during the March events. (p10) [MUL]
* Experienced a high tidal level (measured 8.63 mAOD) during the 11th March 2020 high tide, contributing to flooding at the Avonmouth location. (p13) [TAB, PAG]
* Lower Severn Internal Drainage Board discharged their duties by managing the rhine drainage network within the Avonmouth area during the tidal event to manage flows and reduce the risk of tidal inundation. (p19)
* {03 Nov 2020, 03 Dec 2020}: High tidal water levels at Avonmouth (predicted and observed) produced a tidal flood risk to Bristol city centre that drove operational responses: forecasts and observed peaks were used to assess whether city defences would provide protection and informed actions such as pre-lowering the floating harbour and opening Eastville Sluices, monitoring tidal gauges, and triggering road closures and warnings to residents and businesses. (p23) [TAB, PAG, MUL]
* Predicted high tidal water levels at Avonmouth (after surge uplift) indicated a risk of tidal flooding propagating up the River Avon into the city centre. The forecasts prompted conversion to city-centre levels, pre-lowering of the floating harbour, advice to open sluices, road closures planning and direct warnings to residents, businesses and vulnerable people. (p24) [PAG]
* {03 Nov 2020, 03 Dec 2020}: Quant: Recorded High Tide Level: 8.63 mAOD (11.03.2020 21:00); 8.44 mAOD (12.03.2020 09:00). Storm surge: 0.84 m; 0.46 m. Prediction forecasting error: 0.10 m underestimated (11.03.2020); 0.14 m underestimated (12.03.2020). (p8) [TAB, PAG, MUL]

* Quant: Peak water levels predicted (mAOD): 7.97, 8.02, 8.53, 8.30, 7.91; city-centre conversion added 150 mm (p24) [PAG]

## Bedminster Bridge
* {03 Nov 2020, 03 Dec 2020}: The Bedminster Bridge tide monitor in the city centre recorded higher-than-predicted high tides on 11–12 March 2020, indicating an underestimated surge and higher tidal levels affecting the city centre. (p8) [TAB, PAG, MUL]
* Recorded high tide levels at Bedminster Bridge on the tidal River Avon exceeded the forecasts, meaning peak water levels in the city centre were higher than predicted. This underestimation persisted despite manual uplift to model predictions and the council’s Avonmouth-to-city-centre adjustment, increasing the risk of higher water levels in the city centre during the events. (p9) [PAG, MUL]
* Observed higher tide level increases at Bedminster Bridge (relative to Avonmouth) indicated that city-centre high tides were larger than the adjusted forecasts, contributing evidence of underestimated tidal heights during the March events. (p10) [MUL]
* Tidal inundation during the 11th March 2020 high tide. Bedminster Bridge has a measured high tide level of 8.81 mAOD recorded for the event and was used to estimate maximum flood depths (Table 6). (p13) [TAB, PAG]
* The tidal gauge at Bedminster Bridge was actively monitored leading up to the 11th March high tide to check the accuracy of predicted storm surge; tidal gauge data were downloaded (recorded) after the event to assess water levels. (p24) [PAG, MUL]
* {03 Nov 2020, 03 Dec 2020}: Quant: Recorded High Tide Level: 8.81 mAOD (11.03.2020 21:15); 8.67 mAOD (12.03.2020 09:10). Storm surge: 1.02 m; 0.69 m. Prediction forecasting error: 0.13 m underestimated (11.03.2020); 0.22 m underestimated (12.03.2020). (p8) [TAB, PAG, MUL]
* Quant: Recorded peaks: 8.81mAOD (11/03/2020) and 8.67mAOD (12/03/2020); predicted peaks (after manual uplift): 8.68mAOD (11/03/2020) and 8.45mAOD (12/03/2020); underestimates: 0.13m (11/03/2020) and 0.22m (12/03/2020); BCC adjustment applied: 0.15m vs actual increases Avonmouth→Bedminster: 0.18m (11/03) and 0.23m (12/03).

* {1981, 1999}: Historically inundated by high-tide/surge events: 1981 event inundated several properties including some on Avon Crescent; 1999 event caused flooding of Avon Crescent and required some property evacuations. (p16) [TAB, MUL]

## Albert Road
* Businesses on Albert Road (e.g. Bristol Animal Rescue Centre, BBL Batteries) were contacted on 11th March and warned of the high tide and potential for tidal/Avon-related flooding and advised to take protective measures (install flood barriers). (p24)

## Bristol Avon Between Avonmouth and Bristol
* The narrowing of the river channel between Avonmouth and the city centre forced water to increase in height as the tide rose, amplifying the increase in water levels upstream and contributing to underestimation of city-centre high tides. (p10) [MUL]
* Quant: 0.18m increase observed to Bedminster Bridge on 11th March 2020; 0.23m on 12th March 2020 (compared with a 0.15m forecast adjustment) (p10) [MUL]

## Cumberland Basin
* Flooding of roads around Cumberland Basin and The Portway; overtopping at the Junction Lock leading to water entering the Floating Harbour; roads in this area were closed on the evening of 11th March and again on the morning of 12th March indicating flooded carriageways. (p14)
* Quant: 0.77 m max flood depth (The Portway); 0.40 m max flood depth (Cumberland Basin Road); overtopping into Floating Harbour; ~4.5 hours road closure (p14)

## Brunel Lock Carpark
* High tidal flooding on 11th March 2020 caused inundation and disruption to the highway network and car parks, prompting active management and closures of roads and car parks (including Portway, Sea Mills Lane, Cattle Market Road, Brunel Lock Carpark, Cumberland Basin Road, River Avon footpath at Crew’s Hole Road and St Phillips). Maintenance contractors were deployed to pump tide water off the highway; the Portway was kept closed overnight when the tide exceeded the forecast. (p18)

## Bristol City Council
* High astronomical spring tides combined with a storm surge caused tidal flooding along the River Avon, significantly impacting roads under BCC's Highway responsibility; one property flooded internally; no essential infrastructure reported flooded. (p3) [PAG]
* Acted as the local authority responding to flooding adjacent to the River Avon: liaised with forecasting services during the events; tasked to investigate potential flood risk mitigation measures (including focusing on Sea Mills); to develop and implement the Bristol Avon Flood Strategy and the Portway flood defence scheme; and to use its Flood Plan guidance when responding to flood warnings and forecasts. (p5) [PAG]
* Within the Bristol City Council boundary, multiple locations adjacent to the River Avon flooded on 11th and 12th March 2020. BCC received multiple flood warnings and tide predictions from the Environment Agency in the week leading up to these high tides. (p6) [PAG, MUL]
* Areas of Bristol (including the city centre) were affected by flooding caused by the tidal River Avon on 11th and 12th March 2020. Bristol City Council received multiple flood warnings and high-tide predictions from the Environment Agency in the week before the event, applied a local 150 mm uplift to Avonmouth forecasts to estimate city-centre high tides (producing forecasts up to 8.68mAOD), and used these forecasts to inform its flood response. (p7) [MUL]
* Bristol City Council (as LLFA) actively responded to the high tides on 11 March 2020: carried out duties under the Flood and Water Management Act, interpreted data and warnings, liaised with EA duty officers, notified at‑risk residents and businesses (e.g. East St, St Phillips, Sea Mills Lane, Paintworks), advised on road signage/closures, collated on-site data, and through Marine Services pre-lowered the Floating Harbour and monitored harbour/tide levels to provide extra storage and protect harbour control assets. (p17) [PAG]
* As the Lead Local Flood Authority, coordinated and executed the council response to the March 2020 high tides: interpreted warnings, liaised with Environment Agency duty officers, notified at-risk residents and businesses, advised and directed highways maintenance on predicted road flooding (signage, closures and pumping), collated site data and managed communications and internal FloodCall coordination. (p18) [PAG]
* Coordinated response and public communications during the tidal flood threat: informed the public of potential flooding and disruption via the BCC website, radio, press releases and social media; liaised with the Environment Agency and Met Office to coordinate actions. (p19) [PAG]
* Bristol City Council activated and used its Flood Plan guidance and took proactive preparedness and response actions to manage the high tides and reduce risk to infrastructure and residential homes. (p22) [PAG]
* {03 Sep 2020, 03 Oct 2020, 03 Nov 2020, 03 Dec 2020}: Bristol City Council conducted emergency operations in response to predicted/observed high tides: converted Avonmouth forecasts to city-centre levels (added 150 mm) to assess risk; notified and advised internal teams and partners; warned residents and businesses; instructed port/harbour actions (pre-lowered floating harbour, advised opening Eastville Sluices); set up a FloodCall; and directed road closures and monitoring (notably the Portway, Sea Mills and multiple river-adjacent roads). (p23) [TAB, PAG, MUL]
* Coordinated immediate response to high tide/tidal surge: received and converted Avonmouth tide forecasts, set up a Flood Call, issued warnings to residents and businesses, advised and instructed road closures (including the Portway closure for the high tide on the evening of 11th March and the morning of 12th March), contacted charities and at-risk businesses, monitored tidal gauges and took photographs of high tide at vulnerable locations (Bathurst Basin, Cattle Market Road, Cumberland Basin, The Portway, Sea Mills), and advised pre-lowering the floating harbour and opening Eastville Sluices. (p24)
* Quant: 1 property (p3) [PAG]
* Quant: 8 locations (p6) [PAG, MUL]
* {03 Sep 2020, 03 Oct 2020, 03 Nov 2020, 03 Dec 2020}: Quant: Portway closed in both directions prior to the evening high tide on 11/03/2020 and closed outbound on the morning high tide on 12/03/2020; conversion applied: +150 mm to translate Avonmouth forecasts to city centre levels. (p23) [TAB, PAG, MUL]

## Environment Agency
* Kept all four Eastville Sluices open during the high tides, reducing fluvial (river) flood flows entering the Floating Harbour as the tidal events occurred. (p11) [MUL]
* The Environment Agency closed the flood gates at Shirehampton on both occasions during the high tides, protecting properties from flooding. (p16) [MUL]
* Quant: four sluices (p11) [MUL]
