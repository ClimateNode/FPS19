Reference document:<br>Bolton Council Flooding Investigation Report: Flooding at Horwich and Lostock on 16th May 2021<br>010\_Bolton/010\_2021\_Bolton/Flooding\_HorwichLostock2021Report.pdf

## Place names with coordinates

### Horwich
* {24 Jul 1964, 1964, 26 Dec 2015, 16 May 2021, 17 May 2021}: Flooding occurred at Horwich and Lostock. (p1)
* Local roads were inundated: Chorley New Road was flooded to around 0.4 m in places preventing vehicle passage. De Havilland Way at its junction with Mansell Way was flooded to around 0.75 metres, preventing vehicle passage and resulting in the northbound carriageway being closed for 24 hours due to deposits of debris. (p11) [IMG]
* Residential properties experienced internal flooding: some properties suffered major flooding (complete inundation of the whole ground floor) and others experienced minor internal flooding. Flooding affected an area of approximately 4 square kilometres with spatial clustering of affected properties (notably a cluster in the southwest). (p12)
* {1964, 26 Dec 2015}: Historic flash flooding in 1964 caused deep inundation (more than 18 inches between Claypool Road and the Bee Hive Hotel), waterfalls over Moorgate Quarry, and around one foot deep flooding in Nuttall Avenue; the Fire Brigade responded to multiple locations (Higher Austins Lane, Lee Lane, Chorley New Road, Dale Street, Bolton Fold Farm) and highway flooding occurred at Chorley New Road, Mill Lane, Winter Hey Lane and Alexandra Road. During Storm Eva (26 December 2015) Horwich town centre experienced flooding to commercial properties around Pearl Brook. (p14) [MUL]
* On 16th May 2021 intense thunderstorms produced extremely intense rainfall and hail over Horwich; this produced flash and surface-water (urban) flooding in the area, with observed flood damage, debris fields and photographic/video evidence recorded. (p18) [IMG]
* Observed flood damage and debris fields evidenced by public photographs and video following intense, localized rainfall on 16/05/2021. Radar and witness evidence show a concentrated area of very heavy rainfall (south‑east of the town centre) that led to surface-water/urban flooding across parts of Horwich. (p19) [PAG]
* Intense, localized heavy rainfall occurred to the south-east of Horwich town centre during the 6‑hour period to 22:15 GMT on 16 May 2021 (radar shows a white/high accumulation area in that location). This intense rainfall is part of the meteorological conditions associated with the 16 May 2021 flood event affecting Horwich and Lostock. (p20) [IMG]
* Intense, localised rainfall and overwhelmed culverts caused overland flows that flooded properties and highways within the town as debris-blocked culverts forced water out of the drainage network. (p22) [IMG]
* Overland flows from the Horwich Golf Course west catchment travelled onto Victoria Road, through the St Johns Church site and down Telford Street, causing significant highway damage, pooling on Chorley New Road and contributing to internal flooding of commercial and education premises. (p25) [IMG, PAG]
* Surface water overland flows from the Horwich Golf Club East catchment entered a culverted watercourse and travelled southwest through residential and industrial areas (via Middlewich Close, under Chorley New Road and through the Horwich Loco Works site) into Nellies Clough, contributing to local urban flooding impacts. (p27) [IMG]
* Residents of Oakfield Close and Claypool Road (riparian owners) were advised to clear and improve the small watercourse at the rear of their properties to remove constraints to flow and ensure it remains free-flowing, indicating the watercourse caused or threatened localised flooding to rear gardens/properties. (p40) [IMG, PAG]
* Surface water flood risk and observed overland flows from the Moor Platt Cough catchment affected low-lying parts of Horwich, with flood routes converging toward the town centre and flood shading extending into residential and business districts. (p41) [IMG]
* The catchment within Horwich (approx. 33 hectares, predominantly developed with sewer drainage) produced overland flows and predicted surface-water flooding; the report highlights culvert inlet and debris-screen issues (St Leonard’s Avenue) and recommends inspection/maintenance and upstream structure monitoring to reduce debris during flood events. (p44) [IMG]
* Sites in Horwich experienced flooding during the 16 May 2021 event; the EA conducted topographical surveys to record flood levels at individual properties, visited affected streets (e.g. Sudbury Drive, Ashridge Close) to gather information, and CCTV inspection of Nellies Clough culvert identified a partial blockage on land at the former Horwich Locomotive works which EA partially relieved. Further culvert surveys were planned. (p58)
* Quant: approximately 4 square kilometres; 3 properties (purple dots); 1 property (orange dot) (p12)
* {1964, 26 Dec 2015}: Quant: more than 18 inches deep; one foot deep (p14) [MUL]
* Quant: 12 commercial premises; 1 school building (p25) [IMG, PAG]

### Chorley New Road, Horwich
* Large overland flows through the urban area parallel to the north east of Chorley New Road overwhelmed culverted watercourses and caused flooding to properties. (p3)
* A-class roads were inundated by flash/surface water flooding on 16 May 2021, preventing vehicle passage and causing significant traffic disruption. Chorley New Road was flooded to around 0.4 m in places preventing vehicles; De Havilland Way at its junction with Mansell Way was flooded to around 0.75 m, preventing vehicle passage and forcing a northbound closure for 24 hours due to deposited debris. (p10) [TAB]
* {1964, 26 Dec 2015}: Reported highway flooding in the 1964 flash flood (fire brigade responses) and flooding incidents in the area during Storm Eva (26th December 2015) including flooding to nearby school site. (p14) [MUL]
* Sections of Chorley New Road experienced concentrated surface-water / flash flooding during the intense thunderstorms on 16 May 2021, with high-risk zones shown on the map and flooding reported on main carriageways and junctions. (p17) [IMG]
* Flows pooled on the flatter land at Chorley New Road as a downstream effect of the overland flow. (p25)
* Flows pooled on the flatter land at Chorley New Road where they merged with other flows, resulting in property flooding downstream. (p28)
* Overland flow reached Chorley New Road. The combined sewer in Chorley New Road surcharged during intense rainfall, with rising water levels in the sewer contributing to backflow into connected properties (notably the adjacent school). (p29)
* {general}: The culverted flow is routed along Chorley New Road in a westerly direction as it leaves the culvert inlet; the plan and text show observed overland flows following this route, conveying runoff along the road corridor toward downstream locations. (p31)
* Overland flows crossed Chorley New Road during the event, passing across the primary school site and contributing to further downstream property flooding. (p32)
* Overland flows and culvert flows interacted with Chorley New Road: the Cedar Avenue West culvert passes under it and the Cedar Avenue East culvert runs along it, with flows along/under the road contributing to observed surface-water flooding and discharge to Moor Platt Clough. (p37)
* Overland flow pooled on Chorley New Road and contributed to the internal flooding of downstream industrial premises. (p38)
* Overland flow from Austins Lane ran onto Chorley New Road and contributed to the flooding of numerous industrial premises along the route. (p42)
* External flooding occurred in the Chorley New Road area; a post-event CCTV inspection indicated tree roots and other faults in a section of a privately owned watercourse contributed to the flooding. (p48)
* Highway flooding at the junction (low spot/runoff) with a risk that large overflows could cause flooding to properties immediately downstream; recommended drainage improvements to reduce this risk. (p52)
* Drainage failures at the junction leading to highway flooding; recommendation to make improvements to drainage at the junction to reduce flood risk to the highway and nearby properties. (p61) [TAB]
* Floodwater covered the entire road surface at the junction, with fast-moving, turbulent flow making the junction impassable and creating hazardous conditions for vehicles and pedestrians. Buildings and parked vehicles at the junction were partially submerged and access was disrupted. (p79) [IMG]
* Quant: 0.4 m depth (p10)

### Lostock Lane, Horwich
* Properties at these locations experienced significant inundation during the event, with floodwater entering buildings to substantial depth. (p3)
* Observed overland flows and predicted surface-water flooding affected Lostock Lane as part of the mapped overland flow route through the developed catchment. (p44)
* Surface water flows coupled with sewage flooding in the road caused internal flooding to properties. The sewer surcharge produced flows spouting from manholes and forced water under the carriageway, causing severe highway damage and requiring road closure and emergency/temporary repairs. (p45) [IMG, PAG]
* Sewer capacity was exceeded causing surcharge and manholes to spout; water forced under the carriageway causing severe highway damage and closure of the road for several days until temporary carriageway repairs. Internal flooding to properties and external flooding to garages; at a few properties flooding reached up to 1 metre deep. Two properties were rendered uninhabitable and residents displaced. (p46)
* Gullies on the highway were obstructed (7 of 19 gullies full of debris), reducing flow into the sewer and contributing to increased overland flow on the road; the sag point in the highway had only a single gully, limiting drainage capacity and increasing highway flooding. (p54)
* Lostock Lane was identified as a high surface-water-risk location where highway and property flooding occurred/was a concern during the event; recommendations include reviewing sewer network capacity and making highway drainage improvements to reduce highway and property flooding risk. (p61) [TAB]
* External and internal flooding incidents occurred at Lostock Lane associated with limitations in sewer pipework capacity. (p64)
* Quant: around 1 metre depth in some properties (p3)
* Quant: 5 properties; road closed for 2 days (p45) [IMG, PAG]
* Quant: 5 properties; 2 properties; up to 1 metre deep (p46)

### Horwich Golf Club
* Surface water / overland flows were observed across the approximately 10-hectare catchment, draining to a privately owned culvert inlet at the rear of St John’s Church and then conveyed in a culvert southwest under private property, Chorley New Road and the Horwich Loco Works site to connect to the Nellies Clough watercourse. (p24) [IMG]
* Overland flow originating in the Horwich Golf Course West Catchment overwhelmed culverts and contributed to downstream internal flooding of commercial premises and a school building. (p25) [IMG]
* The culverted watercourse on Horwich Golf Course had an inlet that was overwhelmed by water and debris; the LLFA met with the Golf Club (site landowner) and agreed actions to improve the inlet structure following the event. (p26)
* Surface water overland flows were observed originating within the Horwich Golf Club East catchment; runoff drained to a privately owned culvert inlet at the rear of Middlewich Close and entered a culverted watercourse that conveys flow southwest toward Nellies Clough. (p27) [IMG]
* Significant water flows were observed issuing from the Golf Course site onto the rear of properties on Middlewich Close and through the College Drive development, then onto Victoria Road; flows continued down Abernethey Street causing highway damage and pooled at Chorley New Road where they merged with other flows causing property flooding and internal flooding to downstream commercial and residential premises. (p28) [IMG]
* Drainage infrastructure on their land (including culvert inlets) must be adequately maintained and constructed to current best practice so that drainage is operational and to reduce the risk of local flooding. (p65)
* Quant: 12 commercial premises; 1 school building (p25) [IMG]
* Quant: 1 school building (p28) [IMG]

### Lostock
* {24 Jul 1964, 1964, 26 Dec 2015, 16 May 2021, 17 May 2021}: Flooding occurred at Horwich and Lostock. (p1)
* Western side of Lostock was heavily impacted by a late‑afternoon thunderstorm on 16 May 2021 causing significant flash and surface water flooding, traffic disruption and many reports of internal and external property flooding. (p10)
* The main area of flooding covered approximately 4 square kilometres. Properties experienced internal flooding, with locations mapped showing complete ground-floor inundation in some cases (major internal flooding) and minor internal flooding in others. (p11)
* Residential properties in Lostock were affected by flooding, shown on the plan of impacted properties. (p12)
* {1964, 26 Dec 2015}: Historical flash flooding reported in 1964 that inundated parts of the area; Storm Eva (26th December 2015) caused river-flooding impacts in the Horwich and Lostock area including flooding to commercial properties around Pearl Brook and to residential properties near Bessy Brook. (p14) [MUL]
* The Lostock area experienced extremely intense rainfall and associated surface-water / flash flooding on 16 May 2021. The reproduced surface-water risk plans and the rainfall analysis show medium to high risk zones across parts of Lostock, with flooding concentrated along low-lying streets and corridors (notably near Chorley New Road and De Havilland Way), affecting residential streets and local infrastructure. (p17) [IMG, PAG]
* A sudden thunderstorm produced a large volume of runoff that overwhelmed multiple culvert inlets; debris-blocked culverts caused flow to bypass the drainage system and continue overland, resulting in flooding across the urban area including properties and highways. (p22)
* Observed overland surface water flows converged towards the culvert inlet at the junction of Austins Lane and St Leonard’s Avenue (in Lostock). The catchment produced a very large volume of flood water during the storm, with observed overland flow routes and surface water flood risk focused along these flow paths and at culvert inlets in the Lostock area. (p41)
* Flooding from Bessy Brook in the Lostock area (including Sudbury Drive / Ashridge Close) resulted in internal flooding to residential properties; additional external flooding occurred in the Chorley New Road / Links Road area, with CCTV evidence showing tree roots and faults in a privately owned watercourse contributed. (p48) [PAG]
* Quant: 105 properties had some internal flooding; 33 Major Internal (Residential); 27 Major Internal (Commercial); 36 Minor Internal (Residential); 9 Integral Garages; 11 Outbuildings and External Garages; 2 Major A‑class roads affected (p10)
* Quant: 11 residential properties (p48) [PAG]

### Sudbury Drive, Lostock
* {general}: Properties in the Sudbury Drive area have experienced flooding in previous events. (p3)
* Fluvial flooding from Bessy Brook inundated Sudbury Drive when the culvert inlet/section was overwhelmed; flooding at this location has historically occurred due to debris blockage or under-capacity culverts, and on 16th May 2021 the culvert capacity was overwhelmed causing flooding of the street and surrounding area. (p47) [PAG]
* Fluvial (river) flooding at the culverted section where the watercourse is culverted, caused when the culvert capacity was overwhelmed; resulted in internal flooding to nearby residential properties. (p48) [PAG]
* Residential properties experienced flooding; Environment Agency officers visited to meet residents, record the impacts at individual properties and collect photographic evidence of flow paths and rack lines. (p58)
* Flooding associated with Bessy Brook at Sudbury Drive / Ashridge Close placed the Sudbury area at risk during the event; the Environment Agency is advised to develop a business case and undertake works to reduce flood risk at this location. (p61) [TAB]
* Flooding / flood risk on Sudbury Drive associated with Bessy Brook; recommended case for works to reduce flood risk and continued project development. (p63)
* Quant: 11 residential properties (p48) [PAG]

### Chorley New Road Primary School
* Chorley New Road Primary Academy suffered major internal flooding during the event. (p10)
* {26 Dec 2015}: The old site of Chorley New Road Primary School was flooded during Storm Eva. (p14)
* Extensive flooding to the ground floor caused considerable damage. A significant component was backflow from the combined sewer in Chorley New Road into the school via toilet connections (no anti‑flood valve fitted). Overland flow converging on the road outside may also have contributed to water entering via doorways. (p29)
* Backflow from the combined foul-and-surface sewer rose through the school’s foul connection and caused internal flooding. Overland flow on the road outside converged near the school and may have entered via doorways, contributing to the flooding. No anti-flood valve was fitted on the school’s foul connection. (p30)
* {general}: The culvert route changes course at the location of Chorley New Road Primary Academy; the academy lies adjacent to the mapped culvert path and observed overland flow route, indicating surface water flows passed alongside the site as runoff was conveyed downstream. (p31)
* Flooding occurred with sewer flows contributing to inundation at these locations during the event, exposing the school and nearby properties/streets to floodwater. (p53)
* Highway drainage on Chorley New Road outside the school was identified as having insufficient capacity during the event, creating overland/surface water flows that interacted with the sewer network and exposed the school to the risk of sewer flooding. The school was advised to install an anti-flood valve on the foul sewer connection to reduce this sewer flooding risk. (p61) [TAB]
* Risk of sewer (foul) flooding associated with the foul sewer connection was identified; owners are advised to install an anti-flood valve to reduce this risk. (p65)

### de Havilland Way, Horwich
* Road closed for several hours due to flooding. (p3)
* Flooding at the junction with Mansell Way reached around 0.75 metres depth, preventing vehicle passage and leading to a northbound closure due to deposits of debris. (p10)
* De Havilland Way is shown on the map within medium-to-high surface-water flood zones and is identified as being within the area that experienced flooding during the intense thunderstorms on 16th May 2021; the road corridor was affected by surface water/flash flooding during that event. (p17)
* Flow of water caused flooding at the De Havilland Way (A6027) and Mansell Way junction; the road was closed to north-bound traffic. (p42)
* Quant: 0.75 metres deep; northbound closure for 24 hours (p10)

### Ashridge Close, Lostock
* {general}: Properties in the Ashridge Close area have experienced flooding in previous events. (p3)
* Fluvial flooding from Bessy Brook inundated Ashridge Close when the culvert inlet/section was overwhelmed; the location has experienced repeated flooding linked to culvert debris blockage or under-capacity, and on 16th May 2021 the culvert capacity was overwhelmed causing flooding at this location. (p47) [PAG]
* Fluvial (river) flooding at the culverted section adjacent to Ashridge Close where the culvert capacity was overwhelmed; contributed to internal flooding of nearby residential properties. (p48) [PAG]
* Residential properties experienced flooding; Environment Agency officers visited to meet residents, record the impacts at individual properties and collect photographic evidence of flow paths and rack lines. (p58)
* Ashridge Close (at Bessy Brook / Sudbury Drive) was identified as an area requiring works to reduce flood risk following flooding associated with the watercourse during the event. (p61) [TAB]
* Flood risk and/or flooding at Ashridge Close linked to Bessy Brook; the report recommends investigating and undertaking works to reduce that flood risk. (p63)
* Quant: 11 residential properties (p48) [PAG]

### Poplar Avenue, Horwich
* Properties at these locations experienced significant inundation during the event, with floodwater entering buildings to substantial depth. (p3)
* Significant overland flows that did not enter the watercourse flowed through private gardens, pathways and roads, causing internal flooding to a high number of properties on Poplar Avenue. (p38)
* Adopted footways west of properties were allowing water to flow toward properties; highway drainage on walkways around Poplar Avenue requires routine maintenance to prevent water reaching properties. (p39)
* Walkways and adopted footways around Poplar Avenue experienced surface water runoff that threatened properties; actions recommended to shed water into the open watercourse and maintain highway drainage to reduce property flood risk. (p61) [TAB, PAG]
* Quant: around 1 metre depth in some properties (p3)

### St Mary's Roman Catholic Primary
* St Mary’s RC Primary School suffered major internal flooding during the event. (p10)
* The school (St Mary’s Roman Catholic Primary School, shown on the map) lies within medium/high surface-water risk zones and was within the area that experienced intense rainfall and associated surface-water flooding on 16 May 2021, indicating potential flooding exposure to the site and access routes. (p17) [IMG]
* Internal flooding affected the school site (St Marys RC Primary School on Victoria Road) when overland flow passed across Chorley New Road and across the primary school site before continuing south. (p32)
* St Mary’s RC Primary School was flooded by overland flow that resulted from the debris-blinded culvert inlet at the downstream end of Nellies Clough. (p33)
* Quant: 1 school building (p32)

### Claypool Road, Horwich
* {1964}: Area between Claypool Road and the Bee Hive Hotel was reported in 1964 to have been flooded with depths of more than 18 inches. (p14)
* Received overland flow from New Chapel Lane; flow into the Claypool Road area damaged footways at the junction with New Chapel Lane and conveyed floodwater into the urban area. (p38)
* Culvert inlet north of Claypool Road and the watercourse at the rear of properties were identified as vulnerable following the event; constrained culvert/watercourse contributed to flood risk to nearby properties and residents were advised (as riparian owners) to improve the watercourse to remove constraints and ensure free flow. (p61) [TAB]
* The watercourse at the rear of properties is constrained; residents (as riparian owners) are advised to undertake improvements to the watercourse to remove constraints and ensure it is free flowing to reduce the risk of flooding to rear of properties. (p65)
* Floodwater covered the entire road surface at the junction, with fast-moving, turbulent flow making the junction impassable and creating hazardous conditions for vehicles and pedestrians. Buildings and parked vehicles at the junction were partially submerged and access was disrupted. (p79) [IMG]
* {1964}: Quant: more than 18 inches deep (p14)

### Victoria Road, Markland Hill
* Surface water / flash flooding concentrated along sections of Victoria Road during the intense thunderstorms on 16 May 2021, affecting the carriageway and adjacent low-lying residential areas. (p17) [IMG]
* Significant flows from Horwich Golf Course issued onto Victoria Road via the St Johns Church site during the event. (p25)
* A downstream section of the culvert located near Victoria Road had a partial blockage due to tree root ingress identified in a post‑event CCTV survey; tree roots were removed and the culvert was returned to full operation. (p26)
* Overland flows issued onto Victoria Road as part of the observed flow route from the golf course, contributing to downstream surface water impacts. (p28)
* Overland flow ran along Victoria Road carrying water from the development/golf course area toward Chorley New Road, contributing to downstream flooding impacts. (p29)
* Victoria Road (location of St Marys RC Primary School) experienced internal flooding at the school site due to overland flows crossing Chorley New Road and flowing over the school grounds. (p32)
* Quant: 1 school building (p32)

### College Drive, Horwich
* Surface-water flooding extended into surrounding residential streets such as College Drive during the intense rainfall and thunderstorms on 16 May 2021, affecting low-lying properties and road surfaces. (p17) [IMG]
* Significant water flows were observed issuing from the Golf Course on to the rear of properties through the College Drive development site; a temporary piped drain installed at the development prevented overland flow entering the culvert, directing flow into the development site. (p28) [PAG]
* Construction works (temporary piped drain replacing an open channel) prevented interception of overland flow, causing flow into the development at Middlewich Close with extensive external flooding to gardens and some internal flooding to newly built property; flows continued overland along Victoria Road, Abernethey Street and onto Chorley New Road. (p29)
* {general}: The Nellies Clough catchment drains to a privately owned culvert inlet at the rear of College Drive. Observed overland surface water flows were routed to this inlet and conveyed into the downstream culvert, concentrating runoff at the rear of properties adjacent to College Drive. (p31)
* Internal property flooding occurred on College Drive as a result of significant overland flows emerging from the culvert inlet at the rear of the street. (p32) [PAG]
* Overland flow generated when debris from an eroded stream blinded the culvert inlet/debris screen at College Drive, causing flooding to properties on the eastern side of College Drive. (p33)
* Residential street carriageway covered by flowing surface water with debris present; parked vehicles and frontages of houses are shown within the flooded area, indicating disruption to access and exposure of properties to floodwater. (p75) [IMG]

### St Leonard\'s Avenue, Horwich
* Most flooding and the properties most significantly impacted were located downstream of the St Leonard‘s Avenue debris screen; the culvert inlet at St Leonard’s Avenue / Austins Lane became blinded by debris, stopping culvert flow and contributing to overland flooding. (p42)
* Referencing the same culvert inlet location: debris blinded the inlet debris screen at St Leonard’s Avenue, preventing water discharge through the culvert and requiring clearance to restore flow. (p43)
* {17 May 2021}: Environment Agency teams attended the debris screen on 17th May 2021 to remove debris and inspect the watercourse upstream of the inlet as part of flood-incident response; related inspection and clearance work continued over the following days and photographic evidence of flow paths/rack lines were recorded. (p58)
* The culvert inlet and debris screen were affected by debris during the flood event, creating a risk of blockage of the culverted system and potential property flooding; the report recommends reviewing inspection and maintenance and possible additional debris screening or monitoring. (p61) [TAB]
* Debris accumulation at the culvert inlet and on the debris screen led to blockages during the flood event; risk of upstream structure collapse producing further debris and exacerbating flooding. Report recommends additional debris screening, CCTV monitoring of debris levels, and enhanced inspection and maintenance to reduce flood impacts. (p63)

### St Joseph's RC High School
* St Joseph’s RC Secondary School suffered major internal flooding during the event. (p10)
* St Joseph’s Roman Catholic High School (labelled on the map) lies within or close to medium-to-high surface-water flood zones and is identified as being within the area that experienced flooding during the intense thunderstorms on 16th May 2021. (p17) [IMG]
* The school site is shown within the Moor Platt Clough catchment flood mapping and lies on/adjacent to observed overland flow routes and 1-in-100 year surface water flood shading on the plan. It is therefore likely to have experienced surface water / overland (urban) flooding as runoff from the catchment converged through the town-centre flow routes during the storm on 16th May 2021. (p41) [IMG]

### UK
* A period of substantial rainfall in early May left soils saturated and a sudden thunderstorm downpour on 16th May 2021 produced rapid surface-water/flash flooding across parts of the UK (particularly north and west). No flood warnings were issued in advance. The Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) carried out site visits after the incident and members of the public supplied photographic evidence and testimonies of the storm impacts. (p21) [PAG]

### Greater Manchester
* {26 Dec 2015}: Widespread river flooding occurred across Greater Manchester during Storm Eva on 26 December 2015; a Greater Manchester-wide Section 19 report was produced documenting the event. (p14)
* {26 Dec 2015, 16 May 2021}: Covered by a Greater Manchester-wide Section 19 report for the 16 May 2021 event; the same area was previously affected by Boxing Day flooding (26 December 2015) which prompted strategic coordination, RMA meetings and prioritisation of mitigation across catchments. (p15) [TAB, PAG, MUL]

### Bolton
* Afternoon thunderstorms produced extremely intense rainfall and hail in the Horwich and Lostock area of Bolton, with observed flood damage and debris fields documented by public photographs and video. The intense rainfall band (shown on the plan) corresponds to the area that received the most intense rainfall and led to localised surface water/flash flooding impacts. (p18) [IMG, PAG]
* {17 May 2021}: Parts of Bolton (the Doffcocker catchment and downstream residential/commercial areas) experienced internal flooding due to outflow from Doffcocker Lodge overwhelming a culvert and causing overland flow. (p49) [IMG]

### Markland Hill
* Properties in the Markland Hill and Doffcocker areas were flooded; locations are identified on the plan of properties impacted by flooding. (p12)
* Parts of Markland Hill are shown as being within the mapped zone of most intense rainfall on 16th May 2021; those parts are therefore likely to have experienced associated surface-water/flash flooding and nearby flood damage/debris. (p18) [IMG]
* The Markland Hill catchment experienced overland surface water flow and some sewer surcharge that caused flooding across the catchment; flooding was confined to low spots in the highway and from runoff from highways. (p51) [IMG]

### Doffcocker
* Properties in the Markland Hill and Doffcocker areas were flooded; locations are identified on the plan of properties impacted by flooding. (p12)
* {17 May 2021}: Outflow from Doffcocker Lodge overwhelmed a culvert under Chorley Old Road, producing overland flow downstream that caused internal flooding to residential properties, a commercial property and a B‑class road. An inspection found debris in a downstream manhole that constrained flow and may have contributed to the flooding. (p49) [IMG, PAG]

### Rivington Grange Estate
* Overland flow from higher golf course land entered the estate at Middlewich Close after an open channel was replaced by pipework, causing extensive external flooding to gardens and some internal flooding to newly built properties within the estate. (p29)

### New Chapel Lane, Horwich
* Significant overland flows issued from the southern end of New Chapel Lane into the Claypool Road area; lack of highway drainage channelled water along the road into the urban area, damaging footways at the junction with Claypool Road and directing floodwater into properties downhill. (p38) [PAG]
* Surface water was channelled along the carriageway into the urban area; informal obstacles (roads, houses, fences) prevented flows entering the watercourse and created a cascade of flooding impacts as water flowed downhill, surrounding properties one after another. (p39) [PAG]
* Surface water overland flows were occurring along the carriageway, leading to a recommendation to make drainage improvements and interventions to better manage overland surface water along New Chapel Lane. (p61) [TAB]

### Dale Street West, Horwich
* {1964}: Fire Brigade answered calls to Dale Street and Bolton Fold Farm during highway/flooding incidents reported in 1964. (p14)
* Internal property flooding occurred on Dale Street West caused by the observed overland flows originating from the Nellies Cough/culvert inlet and routing through the area. (p32)
* Dale Street West experienced flooding due to overland flow caused by the debris-blinded culvert inlet at College Drive. (p33)

### Austin's Lane, Horwich
* Austins Lane is within the mapped area where medium to high surface-water flood zones occur and was within the area affected by the intense thunderstorms on 16 May 2021, resulting in surface-water flooding impacts to the lane and adjacent areas. (p17) [IMG]
* Debris washed into the culvert inlet at St Leonard’s Avenue / Austins Lane blinded the debris screen and stopped culvert flow; a considerable overland flow then ran down Austins Lane onto Chorley New Road contributing to flooding of industrial premises and leading to downstream road flooding at the De Havilland Way (A6027) / Mansell Way junction. (p42) [PAG]
* At the culvert inlet serving the junction with Austins Lane a considerable amount of debris washed into the debris screen, blinding it and stopping water passing down the culvert; clearance was required to restore flow. (p43)

### Medway Drive, Horwich
* Sewer surcharge on Medway Drive caused flooding to an external garage; surcharge was attributed to a sewer blockage and occurred as a downstream impact of overland flow from the Ridgmont Cemetery catchment. (p23)
* Flooding occurred with sewer flows contributing to inundation at these locations during the event, exposing the school and nearby properties/streets to floodwater. (p53)
* Quant: 1 external garage (p23)

### Fleet Street, Horwich
* Significant overland surface water flow occurred along Fleet Street and continued onto Chorley Old Road, contributing to downstream internal flooding of properties and flooding of external garages. (p23)
* Surface-water / highway drainage issues were identified on Fleet Street (gully blockage/insufficient maintenance), prompting the recommendation for more frequent routine gully cleaning to reduce highway flooding and manage overland flows. (p61) [TAB]
* Quant: 2 properties (p23)

### Middlewich Close, Horwich
* The privately owned culvert inlet located at the rear of Middlewich Close received observed overland flows from the Horwich Golf Club East catchment and conveyed those flows into the downstream culvert during the event. (p27)
* Overland flow from higher golf course land entered the Rivington Grange estate at Middlewich Close after a temporary piped drain prevented flow entering the downstream culvert. This caused extensive external flooding to gardens and some internal flooding to newly built property. (p29)

### Cedar Avenue, Horwich
* Significant overland flow moved through the Cedar Avenue West catchment causing surface-water inundation within the catchment; flow entered the culvert at the western end of Cedar Avenue, passed under Chorley New Road and discharged to the Moor Platt Clough culvert, forming part of the observed overland flow routes and mapped flood extent. (p37) [PAG]
* Culvert inlet on Cedar Avenue received a significant quantity of debris washed into the screen, blinding the screen to around 85PCSYM of its area; as a result flow passed overland downstream, contributing to pooling and flooding on Chorley New Road and adjacent premises. (p38)

### Oakfield Close, Horwich
* Overland flow from fields east of New Chapel Lane entered the Oakfield Close area; a culvert whose capacity has been compromised by historic ad hoc alterations restricted flow and contributed to flooding within the area. (p39)
* Properties on Oakfield Close (and Claypool Road) were affected by constrained/blocked watercourse flows at the rear of properties during the event, leading to flooding risk; residents were advised as riparian owners to undertake improvements so the watercourse is free-flowing to reduce property flooding. (p61) [TAB]
* Residents (as riparian owners) were advised to improve the rear watercourse to remove constraints to flow and ensure it remains free-flowing, indicating the watercourse had contributed to flooding issues at properties. (p65)

### Fall Birch Road, Horwich
* Observed overland flows and predicted surface-water flooding affected the Fall Birch Road area as part of the catchment runoff; surface water followed mapped overland flow routes across the developed catchment. (p44)
* The c.33 hectare catchment (mostly developed) experienced overland flows and surface water flooding: upper reaches saw flows from adjacent fields entering developed areas and flooding properties and gardens; within the catchment there was internal flooding to residential properties and external garages; lower areas (Lostock Lane) experienced combined surface water and sewer flooding with consequential highway damage. (p45)
* Surface water risk at Fall Birch Road led to recommendations to alter kerbing, height and/or camber and make highway drainage improvements so surface water is contained in the carriageway and to reduce the risk of property flooding. (p61)

### Mansell Way, Horwich
* A-class roads were inundated by flash/surface water flooding on 16 May 2021, preventing vehicle passage and causing significant traffic disruption. Chorley New Road was flooded to around 0.4 m in places preventing vehicles; De Havilland Way at its junction with Mansell Way was flooded to around 0.75 m, preventing vehicle passage and forcing a northbound closure for 24 hours due to deposited debris. (p10) [TAB]
* {general}: Commercial premises on Mansell Way have experienced repeated flooding incidents since the area was developed in the 1990s. (p14)

### Nuttall Avenue, Horwich
* {1964}: Reported flooding to a depth of one foot in Nuttall Avenue during the 1964 flash flood. (p14)
* {1964}: Quant: 1 foot deep (p14)

### Chorley Old Road, Doffcocker
* Overland flow from the Ridgmont catchment and along Fleet Street ran onto Chorley Old Road, forming part of the observed flow routes that led to downstream internal flooding and flooding of garages. (p23) [IMG]
* {17 May 2021}: The culvert under Chorley Old Road was overwhelmed by outflow; an inspection found debris in a manhole that constrained flow and may have contributed to the flooding. Downstream overland flow from this failure led to internal flooding of properties and a B-class road. (p49)

### Telford Street, Horwich
* Overland flow travelled down Telford Street and caused significant highway damage. (p25)
* Chorley New Road flooding between its junctions with Telford Street and Victoria Road highlighted inadequate highway drainage outside the school, indicating surface water flooding affected this road section and junction area. (p61) [TAB]

### Abernethy Street, Horwich
* Overland flow travelled down Abernethey Street causing highway damage. (p28)
* Overland flow ran along Abernethey Street as part of the flow path from the development/golf course towards Chorley New Road, contributing to downstream flooding. (p29)

### Ainsworth Avenue, Horwich
* Surface water overland flows affected the highway corridor between Ainsworth Avenue and the nearby Beehive roundabout, contributing to highway flooding and prompting recommendations to examine and improve drainage to reduce flood risk. (p39)
* Highway drainage between Ainsworth Avenue and the Beehive roundabout experienced surface water overland flows/highway flooding; authorities were advised to examine and improve drainage to reduce highway flooding risk. (p61) [TAB]

### Wimborne Close, Horwich
* The culvert inlet and debris screen at the rear of Wimborne Close were overwhelmed by flow, causing overland flow from the culvert outlet area down a footpath and onto Barford Grove; post‑event inspection found the debris screen around 50PCSYM blinded and the culvert largely clear on CCTV. (p42)

### Haslam Hall Mews, Markland Hill
* Highway flooding at the junction (low spot/runoff) with a risk that large overflows could cause flooding to properties immediately downstream; recommended drainage improvements to reduce this risk. (p52)
* Drainage failures at the junction leading to highway flooding; recommendation to make improvements to drainage at the junction to reduce flood risk to the highway and nearby properties. (p61) [TAB]

### Mason Street, Horwich
* The small bridge carrying the adopted link footway over Pearl Brook creates a restriction on the brook and is identified as a source of flooding to nearby streets (contributed to flooding impacts observed at Mason Street and Vale Avenue). (p54)

### Victoria Road, Markland Hill
* Chorley New Road flooding between its junctions with Telford Street and Victoria Road highlighted inadequate highway drainage outside the school, indicating surface water flooding affected this road section and junction area. (p61) [TAB]
* Severe street flooding across Victoria Road near St Johns Church; water flowed rapidly across the road and from the church grounds, inundating the pavement and road surface and creating hazardous driving conditions (vehicle seen driving through deep water). (p78) [IMG]

### Mill Lane, Horwich
* {24 Jul 1964}: Experienced highway flooding during the flash flood reported in July 1964; the Fire Brigade attended flooding at Mill Lane. (p14)

### Gloucester Avenue, Horwich
* Surface-water flooding affected Gloucester Avenue during the intense thunderstorms on 16 May 2021, with medium/low risk zones shown on the map extending into this residential street. (p17) [IMG]

### Barford Grove, Horwich
* The culvert inlet and debris screen serving the rear of Wimborne Drive were overwhelmed, producing overland flow that ran along a public right of way and onto Barford Grove. (p42)

### Links Road, Horwich
* External flooding occurred in the Links Road area; CCTV inspection after the event showed tree roots and faults in a privately owned watercourse contributed to the problem. (p48)

### Greenstone Avenue, Horwich
* The small bridge carrying the adopted link footway over Pearl Brook creates a restriction on the brook and is identified as a source of flooding to nearby streets (contributed to flooding impacts observed at Mason Street and Vale Avenue). (p54)

### Vale Avenue, Horwich
* Flooding occurred on these streets as a result of restriction on Pearl Brook (the small bridge over the brook caused flow restriction and led to flooding at Mason Street and Vale Avenue). (p54)

### St John's Methodist Church
* The culvert inlet at the rear of St Johns Church was overwhelmed and blinded by soil and silt debris, increasing overland flow; inspection noted the inlet’s poor condition and design. (p25) [PAG]
* A culvert inlet at the rear of St Johns Church was overwhelmed by water and debris (soil and silt), which blinded the inlet and increased overland flow from the site; this overland flow contributed to downstream internal flooding of commercial premises. (p26)
* Floodwater flowed from the church grounds down the entrance steps onto the pavement and road, contributing to local inundation at the church entrance and surrounding street. (p78) [IMG]
* Quant: 12 commercial premises; 1 school building (p26)

### Bessy Brook
* {26 Dec 2015}: Flooding of residential properties at Bessy Brook (near Lostock Station) during Storm Eva. (p14)
* Fluvial flooding occurred lower in the catchment at Sudbury Drive / Ashridge Close. Flooding at this location has happened on multiple occasions and in this event was caused when the culvert capacity was overwhelmed (previous incidents are generally due to debris-screen blockage at the culvert inlet or under-capacity of a culvert section). (p47) [IMG, PAG]
* Bessy Brook presented a flood risk at the Sudbury Drive / Ashridge Close area; the report recommends developing a project and undertaking works to reduce flood risk from the brook. (p63)

### Pearl Brook
* {26 Dec 2015}: Flooding of commercial properties around Pearl Brook in Horwich town centre during Storm Eva. (p14)
* The downstream culvert discharges to a tributary of Pearl Brook after passing under the Horwich Loco Works Site; therefore runoff from the Nellies Clough catchment was routed into the Pearl Brook system, increasing flows entering that watercourse. (p31)
* The brook was restricted by a small bridge (walkway) which acted as a source of flooding to adjacent streets (Mason Street and Vale Avenue) during the event. (p54)

### Beehive Roundabout
* The Beehive area is shown adjacent to medium-to-high surface-water flood zones on the map and is therefore identified as being within the area that experienced surface water flooding during the intense rainfall and thunderstorms on 16th May 2021. (p17) [IMG]
* The Beehive roundabout area was identified in relation to highway drainage issues where overland flows contributed to highway flooding; investigators recommended examining drainage around the roundabout to reduce flood risk. (p39)
* The Beehive roundabout area was identified as a location where surface water overland flows caused highway flooding issues; recommendations include examining drainage on the approach between Ainsworth Avenue and the roundabout to reduce flood risk. (p61) [TAB]

### Loco Works
* The culverted watercourse that drains the Horwich Golf Course West catchment runs southwest and connects to Nellies Clough within the Loco Works / industrial estate. The published plan shows predicted surface water flooding and the route of observed overland flows reaching the Loco Works / Horwich Loco Industrial Estate, indicating the estate was on the flow route and affected by surface water/river-related flooding during the event. (p24) [IMG]
* {general}: The culvert runs beneath the Horwich Loco Works Site where flows from the Nellies Clough catchment merge with flows from Horwich Golf Course catchments and discharge to a tributary; this concentrates runoff beneath the site and routes it to the downstream watercourse. (p31)
* A partial blockage of a culvert was identified on land at the former Horwich Locomotive works site caused by debris from the storm; the Environment Agency undertook works to partially relieve this blockage. (p58)

### Ridgmont Park
* Overland surface water flow routed eastward through the Ridgmont Park catchment (originating across Ridgmont Cemetery). This contributed to downstream internal flooding of properties and caused flooding of garages including an Integral garage and an outbuilding; a separate sewer surcharge on Medway Drive also flooded an external garage (attributed to a sewer blockage). (p23) [IMG]
* Quant: 2 properties; 1 external garage (Medway Drive sewer surcharge) (p23) [IMG]

### Doffcocker Lodge
* Debris accumulated in a manhole in the culvert downstream of Doffcocker Lodge constrained flow through the culvert and may have contributed to downstream internal flooding. Downstream overflows from the lodge resulted in internal flooding to residential properties, commercial property and a B‑class road; the debris was removed after inspection. (p50)
* Overflows from the lodge (large overflows) have the potential to cause flooding to properties immediately downstream; recommendation to improve the downstream culvert capacity to prevent such property flooding. (p61) [TAB]

### Claypool Primary School
* Claypool Primary School is shown on the map within the mapped surface-water flood zones and therefore is identified as lying in an area that experienced surface water flooding during the intense rainfall and thunderstorms on 16th May 2021. (p17) [IMG]

### Meadow Hill Tennis Club
* Meadow Hill Tennis Club is identified on the map within or adjacent to medium/low surface-water flood zones and is therefore within the area that experienced surface water flooding during the intense thunderstorms on 16th May 2021. (p17) [IMG]

### Ridgmont Cemetery
* Overland runoff routed through Ridgmont Cemetery (the principal land use in the catchment). The cemetery-generated run-off fed flows onto Fleet Street and Chorley Old Road and contributed to downstream internal and garage flooding. (p23) [IMG]

### Paragon Business Park
* The map shows 1-in-100 year surface water flood shading extending into business districts within the catchment boundary; Paragon Business Park is labeled within the map extent and is located in an area where the map indicates flood risk and nearby observed overland flow routes, suggesting it was within the predicted/observed flood extent. (p41) [IMG]


## Topics without coordinates

### Nellies Clough
* The culverted flow from the Horwich Golf Club East catchment is conveyed into and connects with the Nellies Clough watercourse within the Loco Works site during the event, meaning Nellies Clough received the runoff delivered by the culvert. (p27)
* The Nellies Clough catchment drains to a privately owned culvert inlet at the rear of College Drive; observed overland flow routes were recorded and are routed into that culvert. The culvert conveys flow southwest under private property, along Chorley New Road, past Chorley New Road Primary Academy and under the Horwich Loco works site where it discharges to a tributary of Pearl Brook, merging with flows from the Horwich Golf Course catchments. (p31) [IMG]
* The Nellies Clough catchment and its valley watercourse generated rapid overland flows during the event that routed through the urban area and contributed to downstream internal property flooding in Horwich (including school and residential/commercial premises). (p32) [IMG, PAG]
* Storm flows visibly eroded and scoured the stream bed over a long length, exposing clean rock and earth and mobilising material. Embankment landslides occurred during the event and released additional earthen material that was washed downstream, contributing to a large debris load. (p33)
* Environment Agency undertook a CCTV survey of the Nellies Clough culvert to identify storm-related issues (partial blockages by debris); EA subsequently contacted riparian owners requesting debris removal. (p58)
* Debris flows and overland surface water routed through the site overwhelmed the inlet structure and created a debris management issue; the inlet capacity and access for screen maintenance were insufficient, creating a risk of blockage and downstream flooding. (p61) [TAB]
* Debris flows and overland surface water flows affected the site; inlet structure and debris screen capacity were insufficient and overland flow routes through the site need bunding/kerb-raising to reduce flood risk. (p63)
* Scour to the stream bed and erosion of banks with exposed soil and destabilised channel margins consistent with recent high-flow flooding. (p76) [PAG]
* Scour to the stream bed and active bank erosion with exposed soil and muddy banks; landslip/erosion of a grassy hillside above the channel forming a small gully or bank collapse; debris accumulation at a culvert inlet and on a debris screen (photo taken 17th May after partial clean). (p77) [IMG, PAG]
* Quant: 1 school building (p32)

### Bolton Council
* As the Highway Authority, Bolton Council undertook post-event gully-emptying on affected roads (response took three weeks) and is considering drainage improvements at the junction of Chorley New Road and Haslam Hall Mews to reduce highway flooding and downstream property risk. (p53) [PAG]
* Responded to flash flooding on 16/05/2021 by deploying a Forward Incident Officer to Horwich (~18:00 on 16/05/2021) to represent the Council, liaise with emergency services and advise/support residents. Over 17–18 May council highway maintenance and street cleansing teams visited locations to remove debris from culvert inlet debris screens, empty highway gullies and clear surface debris. Officers identified vulnerable persons impacted and passed details to Adult Services for welfare checks. Additional highway inspections and CCTV surveys of culverted watercourses were undertaken after the event to assess damage, blockages and to contact riparian owners for remedial maintenance. (p56)
* Flooding on 16 May 2021 caused damage to council-managed assets, including significant damage to schools and roads, prompting repair works, support to children’s services and welfare checks for affected/vulnerable residents as part of the recovery programme. (p57)
* Responded to flooding on 16th May 2021 with urgent carriageway and footway cleaning, urgent gully cleaning on affected streets, safety inspections of rights of way/carriageways/footways, emergency repairs to carriageways and footways, visits and advice to residents reporting flood damage, support and rehousing for vulnerable adults, CCTV inspections of culverts, and establishment of a Flood Recovery Group to coordinate activities. Costs of emergency response/clean-up and repairs were estimated. (p58)
* Quant: approximately 110 properties impacted; 59 residential properties internally flooded; 27 commercial premises internally flooded; 9 integral garages; 11 detached garages or outbuildings (p56)

### United Utilities
* As the maintainer of the sewer network, United Utilities’ sewer flows contributed to flooding at Lostock Lane, Chorley New Road Primary School and Medway Drive. (p53)
* Sewer surcharge was observed during the event causing external and/or internal flooding incidents; United Utilities are advised to record such incidents and review sewer capacity (including at Lostock Lane) to justify and inform future sewerage investment. (p61) [TAB]
* Sewer surcharge from United Utilities’ network was observed and caused external and/or internal flooding incidents; the sewerage undertaker is asked to ensure such incidents are recorded to support future investment. (p63)

### Environment Agency
* {26 Dec 2015}: Engaged consultants since Boxing Day (26 December 2015) to investigate possible improvements to the Bessy Brook debris screen; committed to applying its ‘Communities at Risk’ approach to develop and prioritise flood mitigation proposals and to share the programme with LLFAs. (p15) [TAB]
* {17 May 2021}: An Environment Agency operational team attended site on 17th May to remove sufficient debris from the debris screen to allow water to begin flowing down the culvert; additional teams continued debris removal over the following days. The EA also surveyed the culvert downstream to its outfall at Middlebrook and found no major issues. (p43)
* {17 May 2021, 18 May 2021}: Environment Agency teams conducted door-to-door enquiries to record property-level flood impacts and advise residents; photographed flow paths and rack lines; attended debris removal at St Leonards Avenue (17 May); a topographical survey team recorded flood levels at properties (18 May); visited Sudbury Drive and Ashridge Close to gather information; undertook CCTV survey of Nellies Clough culvert, identified a partial blockage on land at the former Horwich Locomotive works and carried out works to partially relieve it; planned further culvert surveys downstream of Moor Platt Clough. (p58) [PAG, MUL]
* Following the 16th May 2021 flash flood, EA CCTV surveyed Nellies Clough culvert and identified a partial blockage by debris on land at the former Horwich Locomotive works site. EA officers contacted riparian owners to request removal of debris and, exercising discretionary powers, undertook works to partially relieve the culvert blockage. EA also planned a follow-up survey of the culvert downstream of Moor Platt Clough to identify operational problems. (p59) [PAG]

### Moor Platt Clough
* Moor Platt Clough (culverted) received discharges from the Cedar Avenue West and East culverts (within Superstore land and at De Havilland Way), resulting in elevated flows within the culvert system and forming part of the observed and modelled flood extents. (p37)
* The Moor Platt Cough catchment generated the greatest volume of flood water during the storm. Observed overland flows across the catchment converged toward the town centre and were conveyed into a culvert that discharges to Middle Brook, producing widespread surface water flooding risk through low-lying urban areas. (p41) [IMG]
* Fast flow along the Moor Platt Clough watercourse caused significant damage to river training walls that supported private gardens and to river banks. (p42)

### Nellies Clough Culvert
* Debris transported by the storm flow quickly blinded the debris screen on the culvert inlet at College Drive, causing the culvert to surcharge and produce overland flow that flooded nearby properties and the school; material was excavated from the inlet the following day. (p33)
* Culvert inlet and debris screen showed remaining obstruction by rocks, branches and debris after a partial clean; evidence of scour to the stream bed plus landslip and erosion around the channel, indicating damage/instability of the culvert/channel during the flood and reduced conveyance capacity. (p78) [IMG]

### Moorgate Quarry
* {1964}: 1964 flash flooding produced waterfalls/overflow over Moorgate Quarry as reported in the local newspaper. (p14)

### Bolton Fold Farm
* {1964}: Fire Brigade answered calls to Dale Street and Bolton Fold Farm during highway/flooding incidents reported in 1964. (p14)

### Horwich College Development
* The development includes an inlet headwall and debris screen at the end of Nellies Clough; the debris load from the eroded stream blinded the debris screen at the culvert inlet. Material was subsequently excavated from in front of the debris screen the following day. Approximately 150 metres of culvert have been constructed within the development site to realign the existing culvert. (p33)
