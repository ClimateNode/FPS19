## Place names with coordinates

### Druids Heath
* Area-wide surface water runoff from allotment gardens entered the built environment during the storm, contributing to internal property and garden flooding in the neighbourhood. (p48)
* Area-level surface water runoff during the storm routed from higher ground into low-lying parts of the neighbourhood; this runoff produced internal property flooding and flooding to gardens, footpaths and the highway in the Bicknell Croft / Saxelby Close locality within Druids Heath. (p50)
* Neighbourhood-level impact: runoff from the storm caused surface-water flows that entered lower-lying property at Garretts Walk within Druids Heath. (p52)
* Surface water runoff during the storm ponded at a low spot in the area and followed the highway network, causing property flooding within the Druids Heath / Monyhull - Sherston Covert area. Two properties in the area were reported flooded (one internal property and additional garden flooding). (p56)
* Area-level impact: surface water and sewer/drainage flooding affected the Druids Heath / Monyhull area; two internal property floodings occurred on Chanston Avenue and flooding affected gardens and the highway within the area. (p100)
* Quant: 4 properties (p48)
* Quant: 11 properties (combined across Bicknell Croft and Saxelby Close) (p50)
* Quant: 1 property (p52)
* Quant: 2 properties; 1 internal property (p56)
* Quant: 2 properties (p100)

### Percy Road, Sparkhill
* Reported internal property flooding during the storm event as floodwater from the River Cole overtopped the channel and entered surrounding streets and properties. (p90)
* One property experienced internal flooding; gardens and the highway adjacent to Dell Road were flooded. Runoff from surrounding highway catchment was conveyed along the highway to the low point in Dell Road, following the identified flood flow route. (p92) [IMG, PAG]
* Runoff from surrounding highway was conveyed to the low point in Dell Road. Elevated water in the Cotteridge Brook and sewer alignment meant the surface water sewer and gullies were unable to discharge, so flood water overtopped the highway and flowed across low-lying land through a property to the watercourse in the rear garden. (p93)
* The breach location is described on the map as being near the intersection of the Main River and Forwood Lane; floodwaters initiated near this area and moved eastward into the neighbourhood. (p94) [IMG]
* Quant: 1 property (p92) [IMG, PAG]
* Quant: 3 properties (p94) [PAG]

### Bryndale Avenue, Birmingham
* Properties were flooded when water ponded and overtopped kerbs, allowing floodwater to enter buildings. In Brandwood and Kings Heath (Newick Grove / Bryndale Avenue) properties were recorded as flooded. (p45) [TAB]
* Internal property flooding reported; gardens and adjacent highway flooded as surface water runoff followed street topography and ponded in a low spot. (p46)
