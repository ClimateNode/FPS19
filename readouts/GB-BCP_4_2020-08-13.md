## Place names with coordinates

### Christchurch
* Localised surface-water urban flooding affecting streets within the Christchurch area (documented at Barrack Road), causing street inundation and disruption to normal traffic flow. (p1)
* Significant surface water / flash flooding incidents occurred across Christchurch. A number of businesses were internally flooded and had to close temporarily; many properties experienced external flooding (mostly gardens); one residential property reported internal flooding. Sewers and drains were surcharged with reports of water ‘fountaining’ from manholes. The Wessex Water foul sewage pumping station south of Somerford Roundabout was overwhelmed. Main roads were flooded causing traffic disruption (about 1/2 hour). (p3)
* The storm epicentre was centred over Christchurch, peaking around 13:45 on 13 August 2020. The storm (approximately 3–4 km wide at the epicentre) produced intense short-duration rainfall that caused extensive surface water flooding and led to sewers and drains surcharging beyond their design capacity in affected areas (including Purewell). This intense, localised rainfall better explains the extensive surface-water impacts recorded. (p9)
* Urban street flooded after heavy rainfall with standing water deep enough to partially submerge car wheels; traffic disrupted as vehicles drove through flooded road. (p13) [IMG, PAG]
* Multiple flooding impacts across the Christchurch area: internal flooding of commercial premises and at least one residence; widespread external/highways flooding with numerous incident reports concentrated in the Christchurch area. Specific recorded impacts include four records of internal flooding of businesses mainly on Somerford Road and one known case of internal residential flooding in Walkford. Incident reports for the event were entered into datasets (30 incidents entered into FORT) and additional reports were received via other reporting systems. (p15)
* Localised flooding caused by heavily silted culverted sections and an obstructed culvert outfall at Disraeli Road (just south of Gladstone Close) where the culvert from Russell Drive opens; the outfall area is silted and obstructed, reducing drainage capacity and contributing to flooding. (p20) [PAG]
* Localised stream backup and reduced drainage conveyance in a residential area (Gladstone Close / Pelham Close area) caused by a silted culvert outlet and overgrown ditches; stream can be surcharged by high tides from Stanpit Marsh/Christchurch Harbour, exacerbating surface water flooding and drainage failure. (p28) [PAG]
* Quant: one residential property; main roads flooded for about 1/2 hour (p3)
* Quant: 4 records of internal flooding of businesses; 1 residential internal flooding; 30 incidents entered into FORT; 69 reports recorded on Firmstep; 37 incidents reported to Bournemouth (p15)

### Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole
* A very intense, localised short-duration thunderstorm produced significant surface water / flash flooding across the conurbation (focused on the eastern side). Businesses were flooded internally and temporarily closed; widespread external garden flooding occurred; traffic disruption on main roads from flooding (lasted about 1/2 hour); sewers and drains surcharged with reports of manholes fountaining. (p3)
* The 13 August 2020 thunderstorm produced intense, localised flash flooding in urban areas of the BCP region, which led to limited property flooding and highlighted the area’s vulnerability to summer thunderstorms. (p23) [PAG]
* The 13th August 2020 event affected the BCP area, demonstrating limitations in surface water monitoring and flood reporting (leading to the recommendation to install an additional rain gauge east of the BCP area around Highcliffe) and revealing shortcomings in watercourse maintenance across the area. (p24)
* Quant: one residential property; main roads flooded for about 1/2 hour (p3)

### Dorset
* An intense, localised storm centred over Christchurch caused extensive surface water flooding in the Purewell/Christchurch area on 13 August 2020. Sewers and drains surcharged (beyond their design capacity), contributing to the surface water flooding and matching predicted flood locations for that area. (p10) [IMG]
* Radar panels covering 13 Aug 2020 show heavy precipitation clusters across central and eastern Dorset (including Dorchester, Blandford Forum and Poole/Bournemouth areas). The pattern of convective, rapidly changing intense rainfall indicates a high potential for widespread surface‑water flooding and localized flash floods across parts of Dorset. (p25) [IMG]
* The drainage ditch for which Dorset is identified as responsible is silted and partially blocked (only approx. 100mm of the culvert pipe visible), causing the shallow stream to surcharge and contribute to localised flooding of the footpath between Pelham Close and Russell Drive and downstream at Gladstone Close/Disraeli Road; overgrown ditches reduce conveyance and exacerbate the flooding. (p26) [IMG]

### Southampton
* Radar panels for 13 August 2020 show persistent very intense convective rainfall in the area near Southampton (magenta/pink colours indicating >16 mm/hr) between 13:00 and 13:30. Such intense short‑duration rainfall is a known driver of surface‑water and flash flooding and would increase local flood risk during that timeframe (the radar was used as part of the investigation into local flooding). (p25) [IMG]

### Portsmouth
* Radar images for 13 August 2020 show persistent very intense convective rainfall in the area near Portsmouth (magenta/pink colours) at 13:00–13:30. This short‑lived intense rainfall is capable of producing surface‑water/flash flooding and is therefore relevant to local flood investigations. (p25) [IMG]

### Purewell
* The Purewell area experienced extensive surface water flooding and sewers/drains appear to have surcharged beyond their design capacity, consistent with the locally intense storm. This matched predicted flooding for that area. (p10)
* Flooding associated with the Purewell stream. Inspections found the lowest culverted sections heavily silted; a survey (28 Aug 2020) concluded the flooding problem was caused downstream at Disraeli Road (just south of Gladstone Close) where the end of the culvert from Russell Drive opens and is silted, with only approx. 100mm of the culvert drainage pipe visible above the water level. Silt appears to be largely garden waste, contributing to reduced conveyance and local flooding. (p21)
* Quant: one incident; return period of the order of 1 in 42 years (p10)

### Bournemouth
* Incidents of flooding were reported to Bournemouth authorities during the event; reports were concentrated in the Christchurch area and much flooding was highways or external flooding. (p14) [PAG]
* Radar maps for 13 Aug 2020 show heavy precipitation affecting coastal Dorset including Poole/Bournemouth. The convective nature and intensification between 13:00 and 13:30 are consistent with risk of rapid surface‑water accumulation and localized flash flooding in urban coastal settlements like Bournemouth. (p25) [IMG]
* Quant: 37 incidents (p14) [PAG]

### Walkford
* A residential property in Walkford suffered internal flooding (internal inundation of a dwelling). (p14)
* Quant: one known case of residential internal flooding (p14)

### Blandford Forum
* Radar imagery for 13 Aug 2020 shows intense, patchy convective rainfall inland north of Southampton (area labelled Blandford Forum and Romsey). Such concentrated short‑duration storms can produce rapid runoff and localised surface‑water or flash flooding, with drainage systems at risk of being overwhelmed. (p25) [IMG]

### Somerford
* Modelled and photographed flooding occurred on the road outside ‘The Somerford’ public house; reporting systems logged the pub centroid though the actual impact was on the adjacent road. (p13) [IMG]

### Dorchester
* The radar imagery for 13 Aug 2020 shows heavy convective rainfall near Dorchester (intense clusters). Such short‑duration high‑intensity storms are liable to cause rapid surface runoff and localised flash flooding, putting drains and low‑lying streets at risk. (p25) [IMG]

### Russell Drive, Christchurch
* Surface water flooding covered the pedestrian path and road on Russel Drive during the event on 13th August 2020. Residents (including elderly residents) called for help as stream levels nearby rapidly rose and they feared being flooded. Photographs show road and adjacent areas inundated, with vehicles and a cyclist navigating floodwater. Sandbags were supplied to some residents, though delivery was likely too late to change the outcome. (p18) [IMG]
* The culvert from Russell Drive discharges at the silted outlet (Disraeli Road); blockage at the outlet restricts flow from this culvert and contributes to flooding. (p20) [IMG]
* Footpath/stream area between Pelham Close and Russell Drive was flooded due to a silted culvert and overgrown drainage ditches. The outfall to Stanpit Marsh can surcharge with high tides, contributing to backwater and local inundation. Investigation found the end of the culvert (from Russell Drive) largely silted, with only approximately 100 mm of the drainage pipe visible above the water level; adjacent drains/ditches are overgrown and choked with roots and silt, reducing conveyance. (p26) [IMG]
* The culvert between Russell Drive and Gladstone Close was inspected because blocked/silted drainage is reducing outfall capacity and contributing to upstream stream surcharge and local flooding. (p27) [PAG]

### Gladstone Close, Christchurch
* Area immediately north of the silted culvert outlet; flooding problem described as occurring just south of Gladstone Close at Disraeli Road due to the blocked culvert. (p20)
* The culvert outlet area just south of Gladstone Close is silted and constricted, contributing to poor drainage and upstream flooding problems along the connected stream and footpath areas. (p27) [IMG, PAG]
* The south culvert exit near Gladstone Close (end of the culvert from Russell Drive, at/just south of Disraeli Road) is silted and submerged, causing stream backup and impaired drainage. Overgrown and silted downstream ditches reduce conveyance, producing localised flooding risk to adjacent residential properties. (p28) [IMG, PAG]
* Localized surface-water at the culvert exit on Gladstone Close, with staff working in the water to clear the outlet—indicates the street vicinity experienced shallow inundation associated with a blocked culvert. (p29) [IMG]

### Hunt Road, Christchurch
* A resident reported the road was flooded and external garden areas likely experienced external flooding; photographic evidence suggests external garden flooding but the number of properties affected is unknown. (p16) [IMG]
* Road flooding observed; photographic evidence and a resident report indicate external flooding of front gardens and the road being inundated, but the exact number of properties with external garden flooding is unknown. (p17)
* Quant: one report (p16) [IMG]

### Stony Lane, Christchurch
* Standing water covered the road surface in the Purewell Lane area, disrupting normal traffic movement as vehicles navigated through the flood. (p16) [IMG]
* {general}: Photographic evidence shows two metal manhole covers on the pavement raised above the surface with visible gaps, indicating surcharging/pressure in the underground drainage or sewer infrastructure consistent with sewer/drainage distress during the flood investigations. (p21) [IMG]

### Pelham Close, Christchurch
* Area adjacent to Pelham Close (footpath/stream) experienced local flooding driven by a blocked/silted culvert from Russell Drive and poorly maintained overgrown drains; culvert outlet was largely submerged and drainage capacity reduced, allowing tidal backflow and local inundation of the shallow stream and embankments. (p26) [IMG]
* Footpath area between Pelham Close and Russell Drive was affected by flooding from a shallow stream that can surcharge with high tides; standing water and poor drainage impacted the pedestrian route and adjacent open space. (p27) [IMG, PAG]

### Barrack Road, Christchurch
* Barrack Road was inundated with standing water; vehicles drove through the water (causing splashing) and normal traffic flow was impeded; pedestrians observed the flooded street from the sidewalk. (p1) [IMG]
* Standing water covered the full width of the road at the intersection, partially submerging vehicle tyres and causing slowed/congested traffic as vehicles attempted to drive through the inundation. (p16) [IMG]

### Somerford Road, Christchurch
* Businesses on Somerford Road experienced internal flooding; records show internal inundation of commercial premises. (p14)
* Quant: four records of internal flooding of businesses (p14)

### Bridge Street, Christchurch
* Street heavily flooded such that a yellow bus was driving through deep standing water; urban transport was disrupted and the road surface was inundated across the visible carriageway. (p16)

### Bargates, Christchurch
* A resident reported the road was flooded and external garden areas likely experienced external flooding; photographic evidence suggests external garden flooding but the number of properties affected is unknown. (p16) [IMG]
* Quant: one report (p16) [IMG]

### Disraeli Road, Christchurch
* Identified as the downstream location where the end of the culvert from Russell Drive opens up; the outlet area is silted and restricted, causing backups and localised flooding upstream. (p20)
* The end of the culvert from Russell Drive opens up just south of Gladstone Close at Disraeli Road where the outfall is silted, restricting flow and causing the upstream stream to surcharge; silt appears to include garden waste, reducing drainage capacity and worsening local flooding. (p27)

### Bridge Street, Christchurch
* Road surface was inundated with standing water, disrupting traffic flow and forcing vehicles to proceed cautiously through flooded conditions. (p16) [IMG]

### Stroud Lane, Christchurch
* {13 Aug 2020, 02 Oct 2020}: Flooding at the junction with Mudeford Lane resulted in road inundation; the junction area was reported as flooded badly (with imagery showing water across the carriageway), contributing to impassability and local disruption. (p17) [IMG, MUL]

### Mudeford Lane, Christchurch
* {13 Aug 2020, 02 Oct 2020}: Area flooded badly with water covering the road surface; flooding was more severe than a gully blockage alone. Wessex Water were contacted and an obstruction in the surface water sewer was found and removed. Imagery documents water deep enough for a small boat and vehicles becoming inoperable. (p17) [MUL]

### Highcliffe and Walkford
* The intense, localised thunderstorm principally affected Walkford and Highcliffe, producing surface water / flash flooding incidents in the area (part of the wider Christchurch impacts such as business internal flooding, garden flooding and short-lived road flooding). (p3)
* Quant: one residential property (p3)

### East Southbourne and Tuckton
* The storm drifted westwards into Southbourne and Tuckton after peaking over Christchurch, contributing to localised surface water flooding and associated sewer/drain surcharge as the storm moved through these neighbourhoods on 13 August 2020. (p9)

### Stanpit Marsh
* Area affected by the Purewell stream flooding incident. Investigation uncovered a previously unrecorded tidal flap valve at the outfall that was found defective; although the flap valve was not relevant to the 13 Aug event (outfall was not tide-locked), it was identified as defective and repairs were underway in Dec 2020. (p21)

### Somerford Roundabout
* The Wessex Water foul sewage pumping station just south of the Somerford Roundabout was overwhelmed, resulting in sewerage flooding in that area. The sewer flooding was part of the incident on 13 Aug 2020; Wessex Water were notified on 21 Aug and attended the site. (p21)


## Topics without coordinates

### Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole Council
* Internal flooding occurred to business premises within the council area; this internal flooding triggered a Clause 19 investigation by the lead local flood authority. (p4)
* Members supplied remaining sandbags to elderly residents as stream levels rapidly rose. The sandbags were delivered after most of the event had passed and are unlikely to have materially reduced flooding, though they provided comfort to residents. The stream was overgrown and lower pipe sections were silted, and ditches where the stream discharges onto the marsh needed clearing — maintenance limitations (split riparian ownership, unsafe working conditions for GM operators) contributed to reduced channel capacity and localised flooding. (p19) [PAG]
* Council was constrained in its ability to maintain the stream banks (could only mow top of bank) and relied on volunteers for in‑stream and ditch clearing; these limitations are described in the context of the silted culverts and blocked drainage that caused localised flooding (notably at Disraeli Road). (p20) [PAG]
* The 13th August 2020 flooding highlighted insufficient resources and unclear internal responsibility within the Council for clearing ordinary watercourses across the region (some of which are the Council‘s responsibility). The event exposed funding and resourcing shortfalls that limited the Council’s ability to undertake major watercourse clearance and flood-related maintenance. (p24)
* CBC staff visited site to investigate localised flooding of the footpath/stream corridor between Pelham Close and Russell Drive. They found the culvert outlet near Gladstone Close / Disraeli Road to be silted and largely submerged, causing the shallow stream to back up and flood the adjacent footpath and low-lying land east of the drainage ditch. They noted the drains/ditches are overgrown and silted, reducing conveyance and contributing to recurrent ponding and surface-water inundation. (p27) [IMG, PAG]
* Quant: at least four business premises (p4)

### Wessex Water
* Wessex Water‘s foul sewage pumping station just south of Somerford Roundabout was overwhelmed during the storm; a number of sewers and drains surcharged with reports of water 'fountaining’ out of manholes. (p3)
* Sections shown as Public Surface Water Sewers (responsibility of Wessex Water) were identified as heavily silted and implicated in the local flooding; responsibility for clearing or confirming ownership of culverts was highlighted as an issue contributing to the flood problem. (p20)
* Their foul sewage pumping station just south of Somerford Roundabout was overwhelmed during the event, causing sewerage flooding. Wessex Water were informed of the incident on 21 Aug 2020 and attended the site to respond. (p21) [IMG, PAG]

### Purewell Stream
* The stream responded very rapidly to the intense, localised rainfall (the catchment coincided with the rainfall epicentre), increasing flows quickly. Multiple local surface water sewers discharge into the stream (notably south of Purewell Road and Pelham Close), producing rapid runoff from impermeable surfaces and contributing to downstream loading of the Stanpit Marsh drainage system and the overall surface water flooding in the area. (p17)
* The stream responded very rapidly to the intense rainfall on 13th August 2020 and rose quickly, causing local flooding risk. Lower sections of the stream pipe network were very silted and the channel was very overgrown; where the stream discharges onto Stanpit Marsh the ditches need clearing. Much of the stream’s flow during the event comprised discharges from local surface water sewers south of Pelham Close and Purewell Road, contributing to the rapid runoff and overflow. (p18) [IMG, PAG]
* Flooding occurred along the Purewell Stream during the 13 August 2020 thunderstorm; poor maintenance of sections of the stream may have exacerbated the flooding. (p23)

### Environment Agency
* Sewers and drains became surcharged during the 13 August 2020 storm with reports of water ‘fountaining’ from manholes. The Wessex Water foul sewage pumping station just south of Somerford Roundabout was overwhelmed. (p3)

### Purewell Traffic Lights
* Floodwater covered the roadway in the vicinity of the traffic lights, disrupting traffic flow at the controlled intersection. (p16) [IMG]

### Gladstone Close South Culvert
* Shallow standing water at the culvert outlet with personnel in waders performing inspection/clearing, indicating culvert blockage and localized surface-water inundation at the culvert exit; clearing works undertaken to restore flow and reduce local inundation risk. (p29) [IMG]
