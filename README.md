# Section 19 Report LLM Analysis

## Intro

This repository contains the outputs to date of an experimental project being undertaken by Helen Jackson for Flooded People using an LLM to extract information on flood impacts from Setion 19 reports.

It contains two types of outputs:
• maps (HTML files)
• readouts (markdown files)
(One of each per individual document)

## Interpretation notes
• Outputs linked to individual Section 19 reports can be identified via the file name of each readout/map in the following format:
[*ISO code of the relevant local authority*](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui#iso:code:3166:GB) _ *index* _ *start date of the event (YYYY-mm-dd)* _ *file extension*
