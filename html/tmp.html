<h2>Bournemouth</h2>
<ul>
<li>The report investigates flooding that affected Bournemouth on 3rd July 2015; it documents the event for local flood investigation purposes (Section 19). (p1)</li>
<li>A very intense thunderstorm on the night of 3 July 2015 caused widespread surface-water (flash) flooding across the Bournemouth conurbation. Many sewers and drains surcharged, causing damage to the highway. Wessex Water and Bournemouth Borough Council undertook urgent carriageway repairs and major clean-up of affected properties and public spaces. (p3)</li>
<li>Many houses and businesses flooded leading to temporary rehousing while properties dried out; businesses lost stock and trading days; roads damaged by surcharging sewers; highway flooding and external flooding recorded in many locations across the town. (p10) [TAB, PAG]</li>
<li>Flash flooding on the night of 3rd July 2015 caused surface-water inundation and the main foul/combined sewer to overflow, producing a significant pollution incident. Parts of local gardens were closed for several days for cleanup. The event generated adverse local media coverage and highlighted borough vulnerability to summer thunderstorms. (p17) [PAG]</li>
<li>Reported and observed surface-water/urban flooding across Bournemouth on 3 July 2015; locations of flooding were mapped in the report (Maps 3, 3(a), 3(b), Map 4 and Map 5) and formed the basis for the investigation and response. (p18)</li>
<li>Rapidly intensifying heavy precipitation moved onshore over Bournemouth during the 22:45–23:15 BST period on 3 July 2015, producing surface-water/flash flooding in the urban area associated with the event. (p21) [IMG]</li>
<li>Bournemouth was affected by the extreme localized rainfall shown on the 03 July radar frames, resulting in flooding impacts in the town associated with that event. (p22) [IMG, PAG]</li>
<li>Very high, localized rainfall rates were observed over central and northern Bournemouth at 23:40 BST on 3 July 2015 (large areas of 16–32 mm/hour and some &gt;32 mm/hour on radar). This intense, concentrated precipitation produced conditions for rapid surface-water (pluvial) flooding within and immediately north of the city boundary. (p23) [IMG, PAG]</li>
<li>Multiple locations across the urban area experienced flooding incidents on 3rd July 2015 (red dots). Incident clusters overlap with previously reported/observed flooding (light blue), indicating recurring vulnerability in central and southern parts of the town, including areas near the coastline. (p29) [IMG]</li>
<li>Across Bournemouth wards shown on the map, multiple surface water flood locations on 3 July 2015 are indicated (red points), with predicted 1-in-100-year (&gt;150mm) flood corridors (magenta) overlapping some actual flood sites — demonstrating urban surface water flooding impacts during the event. (p30) [IMG]</li>

</ul>
<h2>Dorset</h2>
<ul>
<li>Emergency services (fire brigade) received a large number of calls covering the Dorset area during the event. (p10)</li>
<li>Rapid intensification and northeastward movement of a precipitation system produced heavy rainfall that moved onshore and covered much of Dorset during the 22:45–23:15 BST sequence on 03 Jul 2015, increasing rainfall coverage and intensity over the county. (p21) [IMG]</li>
<li>Quant: 120 calls (p10)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Southampton</h2>
<ul>
<li>The precipitation system moved inland over Hampshire during 22:45–23:15 BST on 03 Jul 2015; heavy rain affected parts of Hampshire, including the area around Southampton, as the system intensified and expanded northeastward. (p21) [IMG]</li>
<li>Radar imagery at 23:35–23:50 BST on 03 July 2015 shows the area immediately inland from the south coast, including the area around Southampton, received the most intense precipitation; this intense rainfall would have generated rapid surface-water runoff and localised flash flooding in and around the urban area. (p22) [IMG]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cumbria</h2>
<ul>
<li>{2015}: Cited as having experienced major flooding associated with Storm Desmond in 2015; used in the report to illustrate previous high-impact flood events. (p17)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Isle of Wight</h2>
<ul>
<li>Moderate to heavy precipitation approached and moved over the Isle of Wight during the 22:45–23:15 BST radar sequence on 03 Jul 2015, with the system progressing northeastward and increasing in intensity. (p21) [IMG]</li>
</ul>
<h2>South England</h2>
<ul>
<li>A concentrated band of very intense rainfall passed over the region on 03 July 2015; this produced rapid surface water runoff and contributed to flash / surface-water flooding across the central southern area, impacting urban centres and transport corridors within the region. (p22) [IMG]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Portsmouth</h2>
<ul>
<li>Radar frames from 03 July 2015 show very intense precipitation centred west of Southampton and Portsmouth; the heavy convective rainfall over and near Portsmouth would have led to rapid surface-water accumulation and contributed to localised flooding pressure on urban drainage. (p22) [IMG]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Redhill</h2>
<ul>
<li>Clustered flood incidents reported in the Redhill and Northbourne ward on 3rd July 2015; internal flooding and combined internal/external incidents were more concentrated in the southern part of Redhill, with external and highway flooding also present. (p26) [IMG]</li>

<li>Commercial properties on Winton High Street (alternative name for Wimborne Road) experienced internal flooding during the event, with property damage and closures for cleanup. (p14)</li>
<li>Quant: 10 commercial properties (p14)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Branksome Wood Road</h2>
<ul>
<li>{Aug 2009, Sept 2012, July 2014, 03 Jul 2015}: Event in 2015 was the worst recorded at this location, resulting in internal flooding of properties; computer modelling indicates the surface water system was overwhelmed and has limited capacity. Wessex Water installed an interim protection scheme following the incident. (p15) [MUL]</li>
<li>{Aug 2009, Sept 2012, July 2014, 03 Jul 2015}: Quant: three properties (p15) [MUL]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mandale Road</h2>
<ul>
<li>Road drainage regularly blocked so water ponded in a low spot for many days; during the event flow ran ‘kerb to kerb’ down the road driven by runoff from the common/industrial area, gardens and detached garages/outbuildings flooded historically, and in this event two properties flooded internally. (p12)</li>
<li>Quant: 2 properties (p12)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mayfair Gardens</h2>
<ul>
<li>Highway flooding in the vicinity; flow overcame a fence and debris built up against it, causing water to build to around 500 mm behind the fence and resulting in internal flooding of properties. (p12)</li>
<li>Quant: 4 properties; 500 mm water build-up (p12)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Surrey Road</h2>
<ul>
<li>At least two properties experienced internal flooding on 3rd July 2015; residents reported water fountaining from manholes (the only public sewer in the road is a foul combined sewer); flooding had previously spilled into gardens; an entirely unknown surface water system taking flows from Surrey Road to the Bourne stream was discovered and found to be in poor condition with several partial collapses; access-improvement works began on 26th Oct to allow future maintenance and repairs. (p15)</li>
<li>Quant: 2 properties (p15)</li>
</ul>
<h2>East Avenue</h2>
<ul>
<li>{July 2007, Sept 2008, June 2009, May 2011, Aug 2011}: Repeated historic surface-water ponding on the highway; at a resident meeting it was reported that 1 house flooded internally and a second nearly did. Investigation found 11 gullies in the road dip but only 4 connected, one connection was root-blocked (now cleared). (p16) [MUL]</li>
<li>{July 2007, Sept 2008, June 2009, May 2011, Aug 2011}: Quant: 11 gullies; 4 connections; 1 house flooded internally; 1 house nearly flooded (p16) [MUL]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Nutley Way</h2>
<ul>
<li>Overland flow routed through rear gardens (natural flow path) from Mandale Road towards Poole Lane; flow was exacerbated by fences and walls which formed mini-dams, increasing local flooding and flow depths. (p12)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Nutley Close</h2>
<ul>
<li>Overland flow passed through rear gardens on its route to Poole Lane; fences and walls along the flow path aggravated the situation by creating a series of small dams. (p12)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Poole Lane</h2>
<ul>
<li>Flow that built up on Mandale Road/Nutley Way/Nutley Close emerged into Poole Lane; highway ponding/standing water has occurred in the vicinity and the reported flow-path routed runoff and debris through back gardens before emerging into Poole Lane. (p12)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Leybourne Avenue</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Leybourne Avenue area flooded on 3 July 2015 when a blockage in the local foul/combined sewer system caused surcharge. A nearby bunded storage area stored less water than expected because an upstream fence became blinded with debris and formed a dam, contributing to the flooding of the area. (p13)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lower Gardens</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lower Gardens in Bournemouth was affected by flooding and contamination from surcharged sewers during the 3 July 2015 storm, necessitating a major clean-up carried out by Wessex Water. (p3)</li>
<li>Closed for several days while Wessex Water carried out a major clean-up after the sewer surcharged during the storm; restricted access to an important local facility and reputational damage despite limited physical damage due to regular prior flooding from the Bourne stream. (p10)</li>
<li>Landscaped public areas were inundated; the combined/foul sewer overflowed causing a significant pollution incident and parts of the gardens were closed for cleanup following the flood. (p16)</li>
<li>Quant: 3 or 4 times a year (p16)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Kinson North</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reported flood incidents across the ward on 3rd July 2015, with external and highway flooding widely distributed; fewer internal incidents reported compared with neighbouring Kinson South. (p26) [IMG]</li>
<li>Flooding incidents occurred within the ward on 3 July 2015; locations shown on the map indicate localised surface-water inundation contributing to repeated flood-prone spots when compared with previous reported incidents. (p28) [IMG]</li>
<li>Locations of flooding on 3 July 2015 are shown within the ward (red markers on the map); flooding clusters occur in the northern/central parts and partially overlap with predicted 1-in-100-year (&gt;150 mm) flood zones. (p30) [IMG]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bournemouth Central</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Central ward experienced multiple reported incidents of internal flooding to premises and inundation of highways/roads on 3 July 2015; the map shows a concentration of red (internal) and cyan (highway) points in the central area. (p27) [IMG]</li>
<li>The Central ward shows a high density of flooding incident locations for 3rd July 2015 (red) that overlap with historical reports (light blue), indicating repeated flood incidents in the central urban area. (p29) [IMG]</li>
<li>Observed flooding points (red) recorded in the central ward on 3 July 2015, showing localised surface-water flooding from intense rainfall. Predicted 1-in-100-year (&gt;150mm) modelled zones (magenta) also cover parts of the ward, indicating overlap between observed and modelled high-risk areas. (p31) [IMG]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bourne Stream</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Bourne Stream regularly over-spills onto the Lower Gardens floodplain and contributed to inundation in this incident. (p16)</li>
<li>Quant: 3 or 4 times a year (p16)</li>
</ul>
<h2>River Bourne</h2>
<ul>
<li>{general}: Regularly causes flooding of the Lower Gardens (especially in winter), contributing to frequent inundation patterns and local adaptation (relative flood resistance of the gardens). (p10) [TAB, PAG]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Turbary Common</h2>
<ul>
<li>Erosion of footpaths indicates high-energy runoff from the common; runoff from the common contributed to large flows that poured down Mandale Road and fed the flooding of adjacent streets and properties. (p12)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Long Road Park</h2>
<ul>
<li>On 3 July 2015 considerable flows entered the playground; an upstream fence became blinded with debris and created a dam which reduced the effective capacity of the bunded storage area. The bund stored some water (tide marks indicate storage) but less than expected, allowing overflow through a grassed overflow channel. (p13)</li>
</ul>
<h2>KFC</h2>
<ul>
<li>Floodwater covered the street and reached storefront entrances, including the KFC shown in the image, indicating the premises frontage was affected and the road was rendered impassable. (p14) [IMG]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Somerset Levels</h2>
<ul>
<li>{general}: Referenced as a previous major flooding event (flooding over the winter of 2013/14) that shaped public perception of flood risk. (p17)</li>
</ul>
<h2>New Forest</h2>
<ul>
<li>The radar sequence shows heavy precipitation moving inland across Hampshire between 22:45 and 23:15 BST on 03 Jul 2015; the New Forest area (labelled on the maps) lay within the region of advancing and intensifying rainfall during that period. (p21) [IMG]</li>
</ul>
<h2>East Cliff and Springbourne</h2>
<ul>
<li>The ward label ‘East Cliff and Springbourne’ appears on the mapped area that shows observed flooding locations (red) and predicted flood zones nearby, indicating the ward was within the area affected by surface-water and watercourse flooding on 3 July 2015. (p31) [IMG]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Boscombe West</h2>
<ul>
<li>Observed surface-water flooding locations (red) within the ward on 3rd July 2015 as shown on the map; some observed flood points coincide with modelled 1-in-100-year (&gt;150mm) predicted flood zones along low-lying corridors. (p31) [IMG]</li>
</ul>
<h1>Unmapped topics</h1>
<h2>Bournemouth Borough Council</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bournemouth Borough Council recorded and responded to widespread flash flooding on the night of 3 July 2015; carried out urgent carriageway repairs where highways were damaged; involved in reporting/recording incidents and supporting cleanup operations alongside Wessex Water. (p3)</li>
<li>Rapid, localised thunderstorm caused surface water flooding: many houses and businesses in the council area were flooded; a number of residents moved to temporary accommodation while properties were drying; businesses lost stock and lost trading days during clean-up; sewers surcharged damaging roads; the Lower Gardens were closed for several days while a major clean-up was carried out after a sewer surcharge; important local facility suffered restricted access and reputational damage. Because of the speed of the event the council did not put an emergency plan into operation and stated it did not have resources to be on stand-by for events assessed as very low overall risk. (p9)</li>
<li>Council resources were mobilised to record and respond to the event; managed consequences including closed public spaces (Lower Gardens), compilation of incident records, dealing with damaged roads caused by surcharging sewers, and supporting displaced residents (temporary accommodation). (p10) [PAG]</li>
<li>Quant: 133 reported or observed incidents; 56 properties flooded internally (p3)</li>
